"In this video childrens were shown whoes homes were destroyed during war and they are seperated from family. I felt sad watching this video. Because war has seperated these childrens from their home and destroyed their home and they have to leave their home and faced difficulties. I felt sad because they have to leave their home behind. When the video started I got little confused about what have happended, but later I felt sad.",1,1,1,TheDisplaced,LVLA,4,3
In this video people and childrens were shown in slum area. The video ended on a happy note with a person playing guitar. In the starting of video their was a lot of confusion and disturbance and crowded place was shown. But when the guitar started playing the emotion was of positveness and hope. It started with little confusion and ended with hope.,1,1,2,HappyLand,LVLA,3,4
"In this video a person who was confined in jail run aways from jail. I didn't felt good watching this, I was feeling bad that he ran away from jail. I felt bad because he was person who performed vilonce and then ran away from jail. ",1,1,3,Jailbreak,LVHA,3,3
"This video was about war and it impact all nation equally. In this video their were scenes of war, tankers, bar and the time of world war is shown. Due to computer generated graphics in between I felt this video was a little superficial. I felt quite sad about seeing the impact of war on the people.",1,1,4,Warknownonation,LVHA,2,2
In this video I jumped into a canyon using a rope. It felt a little scary. I felt scared when the person jumped into the canyon. I felt there is nothing infront of me and at the back of me and I was haning in midst of no-where.,1,1,5,CanyonSwing,HVHA,3,3
In this video I felt pleasant and relaxed. I was in forest it felt silent and nice.,1,1,6,Redwoods,HVLA,3,3
I felt sacred and little enthusiasitic but at some point in video I felt a liitle nausea. I was scared of the height.,1,1,7,Speedflying,HVHA,4,4
It was about sea and beach. I felt relaxed. There was sunset. There was a ship. I felt excited in the ship. There was slide shown in between the video where I felt excited It was a good relaxed video.,1,1,8,InstantCaribbean,HVLA,4,2
"Firstly, the first video started, and I was like, it was really nice like I was feeling like I was actually there, but the situation wasn't good. And there was a child, and firstly, I thought it's like kind of a horror movie or something, but then I got to know, no, it's not a horror movie, it's an actual thing. Yeah, so in the first video when it started, there were two kids, one was Shawn, and I don't remember the first name. And then, a little bit of the intro, and then their story started, and I felt really sad when it was said that Shawn was killed by crocodiles rather than surviving. It was so sad, and she lost her mother. it's really sad that people who are just living a happy life, but just because of this displacement, they are at their lowest.",2,1,1,TheDisplaced,LVLA,2,3
"so it's a situation common in every country, people living in poor conditions. And you felt bad for the kids. You felt like it was very real, like you were actually there like i have seen such places in India also and really feeling bad for these little little kids and it was very. They were so cute and they were so curious for people recording them. yeah so actually it was feeling very real like I  was there only . but yeah as also feeling like  actually, we, actually government  or something is actually or we actually are also not doing something on larger scale . ",2,1,2,HappyLand,LVLA,1,3
"Yeah, so there was a criminal who was... yeah, it was kind of exciting because all around, all 360 degrees, something was going on, something was happening here, here, and I was like, I'm looking here, then something happened here, I was like, ""Oh, okay, okay."" It was like, where is actually things happening, and I was just finding it. But they talked about this criminal being violent, but still, because the video was made that way. it was like, what's gonna happen next? And like when he was just opening his handcuffs, and I was like, ""He just opened his handcuffs!"" And he has handcuffs and something's gonna happen because the policeman was taking him and his handcuffs are open. Okay, so it was kind of exciting. It was kind of like actual. I felt like I was feeling more in this video. The content was like, I was more focused on the content. Like when they changed the camera, I was firstly, I was feeling like I am a CCTV camera, and then it changed to like, I am with the criminal now. Now I am just looking because they were seen. I was looking at the policeman. Then yeah. And then I was just looking at people talking there about something, and then the criminal just ran away from there. I was like, something happened there. Yeah. And this still was like, I was just rotating my head.",2,1,3,Jailbreak,LVHA,3,4
"Yeah, it was... I felt it was a little heartbreaking. More than the first two videos, they were sad, but it was how it was created, like when the person... the narration type thing. And so they have shown different people, different nations, and then what, because like this war thing, I actually read about this a lot during World War Two or One. So I have seen all these pictures, and so I was actually feeling that thing, like people are going there. So it was kind of I feel more connected. It was actually... I was like, I love this video, actually. And it was actually like, at first, they were showing, like, his wife or girlfriend. She was just waiting on the train scene, and that was actually... I felt like really... like they were waiting for them, and they don't know if they'll come back or not. And like the last scene...I felt actually good while scene changing because I was like, now I'm gonna watch something, and then this... It's like kind of movies or something. So, there was like a suspense creation in that time when there was a graphic, and when they were real. So, yeah.",2,1,4,Warknownonation,LVHA,4,2
"This was the video i was actually feeling like my heart was beating like when he just jumped. I was like  ""i'm gone"". Like i was just facing at the view he was facing in the video.",2,1,5,CanyonSwing,HVHA,5,5
"umm actually i didn't found it any interesting as nothing was happening there. so it was just quite. i just wanted to go there . move but i was constantly just standing there…. And the person was clicking pictures and i was just there so at that time i felt like i was on a robotic chair and it’s moving on it’s own. it was changing very slow so the video got boring for me. like i can’t move. the music in this video created some irritation type something. I like going to nature. I love going in nature, but I like to move and feel the thing. But in that video, I wasn't feeling the thing, because the person was going on, and I was like, ""I can't move."" ",2,1,6,Redwoods,HVLA,3,5
This video was the was the least interesting video. yeah the thing i noticed that  in the falling video there was no music so i was feeling everything kind of real but in this video there was music so no. it was like you were watching something but you are not in the situation.,2,1,7,Speedflying,HVHA,2,4
"I loved this video. And like, whoever was narrating that, and it was also good. Because everyone was going in the slide. I was like, when will I go in the slide? They are saying, ""You will go in the slide."" When will I go in the slide? But suddenly, they changed, and I was like, okay, now in the slide.  I was just looking at the sunset. I was like, when they said, like, ""You're not going to..."" I was like, I don't want to go. I just want to stay there. they said, ""You have to go back to reality."" I was like, ""Please, keep me there."" ",2,1,8,InstantCaribbean,HVLA,5,5
"So, it was about what they have shown - various scenes of war.  It did not feel real, it felt like a movie.  So, not okay. I felt neutral, not that engagning emotion-wise. No, because I am aware that it happened, so it did not feel like it's happening right now. ",3,3,1,Warknownonation,LVHA,3,1
This one was very boring. I was supposed to watch trees. One person came in between but then he disappered and I was looking for the guy. The guy in start took a picture and then nothing happened.,3,3,2,Redwoods,HVLA,2,5
"This one was nice, but I was not able to grasp the point. And also, um, so there was...I could not see which part to focus on, like I could not see who was talking. It was a narration, like a narrator. So, I could not see. So, here they were talking to a girl, but he was looking somewhere else. Like, they were talking to this girl. It was very confusing as what they want to tell.",3,3,3,HappyLand,LVLA,2,3
"This one was good. This was exciting. Yeah, also the vlog-like feel. Like, this guy talks to the camera, and at the start, it is good. I noticed the poor quality but I liked it anyway. Not really, but it was nice to look at. It was like I was right there, but I don't have a particular liking for adventure sports as such. But I liked this one.",3,3,4,Speedflying,HVHA,5,2
"This one, yeah, this one. I appreciate the video. Okay, but did not engage me that much. Maybe I am just not fond of beaches or things. It looked like an advertisement at first. Not as okay. In the end, there was also a sunset. I did not like it. I think I just don't like looking at it. It looked like an ad. It was not fun.",3,3,5,InstantCaribbean,HVLA,3,5
"This one was the most fun video. I watch like shows based on crime, so it was nice. I was looking forward to more content like I wanted to see. seemed a little fake in between, but okay. But, this was exciting to watch.",3,3,6,Jailbreak,LVHA,4,5
"This was good. If this was real, I think this was real, right? I just don't like where people are telling you stuff, and it's like...There's a lot of information, and it's not in a good way, like... Okay? I was tired, but did not.",3,3,7,TheDisplaced,LVLA,2,4
This was nice.  It was good. I felt a little bit scared. May be a little bit afraid.,3,3,8,CanyonSwing,HVHA,3,5
"So they were trying to kidnap a person. It was kind of... So, I think it was supposed to induce some scary feeling, but they were funny. So, I thought it was funny. they were acting like jokers or whatever, haha. First time I entered the room, I don't know what this said, but it was like, I think I laughed a bit. ",4,4,1,Kidnapped,LVHA,5,3
"Calm, yeah. I felt very calm. I like serene environment in front of me. So, I was just observing either, and I saw crabs and all so it was very calm. I just found out as a person sitting and behind me. So, was that like a guy or a girl? So I did had a doubt about that one person at the back. And at the end their was a sunset and sky was orange. ",4,4,2,MalaekahanaSunrise,HVLA,5,1
"In this video I did not feel funny. I did not also felt scary as it was not able to induce scary emotion. Because I am accustomed to it. I was not sure if their were zombies or mental hospital patients at one point, but then I think it was zombies only. So, that was not clear, okay. It was not scary and it was not, I was alert and I was looking for a jump scare. I was just preparing for something to happen, some jumpscare. I was anticipating. I looking for just genuinely interested in what they are doing, and zombies may be a lot of sci-fi media moveis have shown different types of zombies. So, I was just observing what characteristics these zombies might have.",4,4,3,ZombieApocalypse,LVHA,4,2
"this was supposed to induce a cheerfully vibe, but since I'm not into dogs that much, so I was pretty calm. So, it was interesting and what I found interesting was because I was an object on the ground, my point of view was seeing the humans as giants. Okay, so that was interesting.  I just found it interesting because I've never seen something from that perspective. I mean, music was like doing it's work, it was cheerful, I felt like bobbing my head to it and just observing around, so I do not know what cheerful is, so I cannot say.",4,4,4,PuppiesHost,HVHA,4,1
"So, in this video, I felt like there is a earthquake and everything is moving. It was pretty shaky because of the transition, it felt like so the transitions were very fast. There was some inquistiveness about how people reached to this beach because there was a forest at the back. I do felt the beach-vibe because a couple was there. The new perspective were fun to watch and were interesting.",4,4,5,GreatOceanRoad,HVLA,4,2
"I like this one the most because this one felt like the most real video graphic wise beacuse no one was there. I also liked the music. overall it created a very calm and serene space for me, yeah. So, this was overall everything. I like this video the best. So, this was the most calming. perspective was the normal one, it felt like I was alone in a parking lot, I don't know if there was a beach or not but I felt like if I walk a little more I will find a beach. I was calm throughout the video, and I really like the video, I was just thinking that I was really enjoying being here.",4,4,6,AbandonedBuilding,LVLA,5,4
"So, I don't know if... See, I'm pretty desensitized, I just went to Nepal, my grandmother live there, so I know what happened and stuff like that, so it did not elicit a response from me. It would have been distressing but I was desensitized to it. There were some places shown in the video where I have actually been to. I think yes, there was a scene in which they were distributing the food so I felt like I was standing there, I think that moment I felt like it was real. ",4,4,7,NepalEarthquake,LVLA,2,3
So that was pretty funny but I enjoyed this one and I think see other ones did not fool my senses but in this one I think something happened. I don't I cannot put it into words but I lost my sense of balance I guess.  So it was exciting.,4,4,8,MegaCoaster,HVHA,5,4
"This one? So, this one was a person kidnapped, two people, and they were talking to him, and they were in the car. A policeman came. So, in this video, I mean, everything was very unexpected. I mean, suddenly, people came in the room, and suddenly, we moved to the car. So, things were quite unexpected and surprising. I felt suprised and curious. I didn't feel any emotion, not much. I felt, at some point, that it's a bit scary. The emotion changed. I mean, I was not curious anymore. I was less curious when I moved into the car from room, and I was a bit, I say, a little fearful.",5,4,1,Kidnapped,LVHA,4,2
"Initially I was expecting something will happen but later I found out it gone be like this. Initially there was not much emotions but later I found I was more calm and relaxed and good. Intially I was alert.  Later I was focused and was observing everything in the video, the sunset, the lobster. I felt like my feets are in sand.",5,4,2,MalaekahanaSunrise,HVLA,5,2
"some people were planning for some they were like gun man and they were planning for some may be war or something like a war is going on and this is the police may be. i was i say curious to know what they are doing and what.  When we moved to the war zone. the emotion changed i mean i was not curious anymore i mean i was less curious now and i was bit i say little fearful i say little bit. I just felt that it was too dark, and for some places, I was not able to understand completely, like, I was not able to look clearly what's happening.",5,4,3,ZombieApocalypse,LVHA,3,2
"So, this was... I say a fun kind of video. I mean, a lot of cute puppies, here and there. I like puppies. Yeah, initially, I saw just puppies, but then I looked around and saw people were there, and then I felt more realistic. And I also saw this one also. This was nice.  ",5,4,4,PuppiesHost,HVHA,4,1
very good yeah this was one of my favorite videos i say i like the perspective like i am like some it seems like i am  flying like that.  i felt i mean very good very happy or happy. because of perspective yes like in the beach video i was more relaxed but this was not as relaxing as that one yeah exciting was there because the perspective was changing every second. i felt like i am in some helicopter sort of thing like i am actually there. ,5,4,5,GreatOceanRoad,HVLA,5,1
again like i was expecting some moment something will be there because the previous video was you know completely moving then after two three seconds i was like okay its going to be relaxed one okay then after some time after like three two three seconds more i realized okay it's raining like the sound of rain was coming like initially I noticed that sound. i felt like i am just sitting with the good friend and relaxing at some place.,5,4,6,AbandonedBuilding,LVLA,3,2
Overall emotion was I say a bit conscious also that anything like this could happen at any place so we need to be conscious. I was contemplating that life could be this way also. Earthquakes can happen suddenly anywhere.,5,4,7,NepalEarthquake,LVLA,3,2
" initially i was excited with this whats gonna be next thing then after like like, it was one minute video so after like 30 40 seconds i started feeling bit tired this needs to be stopped i kind of started feeling tired and like a loss of sense of balance. at some point i felt like my head is like rolling kind of at some point. i say in the beginning the excitement level was more and when it moved on it gradually bit reduced.  ",5,4,8,MegaCoaster,HVHA,4,2
"Distressed, because of all the loss. And all that happened in Nepal. I mean, not distress, more like sad. I have seen about earthquake on television but seeing it in TV made it bit more involving. I was stable sad throughout.",6,2,1,NepalEarthquake,LVLA,2,3
"So, this was, Starting I was bit confused I wasn't sure what was happening. Then, it was a bit interesting, after that, I found it a bit funny because like, the other people, zombies, they were not like scary. Okay, but I wasn't scared, but I was interested. And at the start, it was a bit confusing because there was no context as such, but later, like, a zombie movie or something. it wasn't scary, like, the zombies were there, there was no, like, there was no doubt. And also, jump scare was not there.",6,2,2,ZombieApocalypse,LVHA,4,4
"So I didn’t understand again what was happening, okay, so this was just a 360 picture but when I looked back there was a cloth moving, so I thought it was a video. But later on the audio was echoing so I didn’t understand what it was saying. The music was calming, But I didn’t understand. I was inquisitive. Okay, so in the audio, I just assumed that it was inspirational, but I did not understand what he was saying because of the echo. ",6,2,3,AbandonedBuilding,LVLA,3,1
"So, there was, in this one, the person wasn't moving at all, the person through which I am seeing, so it felt a bit unrealistic, like, right now, if someone is... Is pointing a gun, I would move or something, but he's just sitting like a mannequin, so that was a bit unrealistic. so like, even if in this video the person was trying to struggle or something, it could be a bit more, like, okay, I'm struggling to get out, there's a bit more sense of fear that I'm trying to get out and all, but here, he's sitting calmly and so it felt a bit unrealistic, and yeah. It was calm, and the person... I think this was a funny video, I think so. It was at the end, it was a bit funny when they were arguing and all that, yeah.",6,2,4,Kidnapped,LVHA,3,2
"so this was a bit... Yeah, nauseating, okay, like, I didn't... I was not feeling that I was in there, but there was this movement, but my body is standing there, like, this still, so there was a bit of motion sickness. So, there... So, in real life, I would... I have motion sickness, I would be avoiding, yeah, so it wasn't that scary, but there was motion sickness, so because I was sitting still, but this was going all the directions. I mean, excitement wasn't there, excitement wasn't there, no, because like, I was... Because somewhere I knew that I am just sitting in a room because I am in a VR simulation only, but if I didn't know that, like I... So, it would have felt... It did feel like I was there, but it wasn't exciting, how should I put this... Like, so, the roller coasters, when you're actually on a roller coaster, there is this sensation... Gravity.  I did feel a bit nauseated, but I wasn't scared. I have never been on a rollercoaster... I don't exactly know how it feels, but yeah, it was not scary, it was a bit exciting, but there was this knowledge that I'm not really there, so that.",6,2,5,MegaCoaster,HVHA,4,4
This was calmimg. I felt calm throughout the video. It was a perfect video.,6,2,6,MalaekahanaSunrise,HVLA,5,1
"So, this was a bit disorienting because, like, it was a cute video, but the dogs were, like, they were jumping on the camera, so that was a bit... So, the perspective-wise, it was... The dogs were, like, I was like a little person, these dogs were huge. I mean, like, puppies, yeah, but, like, it wasn't scary, it was cute, but they were, like... So, this sense of, like, if I was a human, a puppy would be somewhere over here, but they were, like, here, and they were huge, so the perspective was an issue here. ",6,2,7,PuppiesHost,HVHA,5,3
"This one was also calming, and, like, there I was on this drone.So, the motion here was slow, so it didn't feel very scary, so it was fine. So like where once this bubble transition, yeah, I was confused for a second, but then I understood transition, but no, it didn't impact, any, it was quite smooth, so it didn't impact the experience ",6,2,8,GreatOceanRoad,HVLA,5,1
"In this video I have a feeling of guilt and a feeling of companionship. It was a little sad. Because they left their homes and got separated from their families, that's why I felt sad. In between, I felt like helping also.",8,1,1,TheDisplaced,LVLA,3,3
"In this video I felt good. I felt like there is a goodness in the world. Inspite of beig in such a condition they were happy. I felt positive, in a positive way.  I felt like the people in video were trying to connect with me. I felt the emotions of hope and kindness.",8,1,2,HappyLand,LVLA,4,4
I felt excited and curious in this video. I felt a sense of running and activeness in this video. I felt very positive emotion in this video. I felt like I was their in the scene and also the jail person felt like talking to me and that made me feel excited. ,8,1,3,Jailbreak,LVHA,4,3
"I felt very confused in this video. Yeah, because of the person changing from old to young. That's why, also, I didn't get the story properly. Just I enjoyed the video, but I thought that it would be better to explain the sequences. I felt a little disconnected from the video. The major emotion was a little proud, a little sense of life watching a video.",8,1,4,Warknownonation,LVHA,3,2
"I felt really excited, enthusiastic and active. I was a little scared when he was at the edge of the cliff. I felt like I jumped. I was a little surprised. ",8,1,5,CanyonSwing,HVHA,4,1
"The major emotion was relaex, chilled.  But the video was trasnsitioning very slow I created a sense of sudden action, I'm just scared of getting a boost, jump scare while watching this. I was alert at the start. I was exploring that maybe someone could or can come from behind from me. Later, I felt relaxed like it is a normal video.",8,1,6,Redwoods,HVLA,3,1
"The major emotion was like the active and enthusiastic and a playful emotion. I also want to do that speed flying acivity in the future. I was a little afraid also then that they would not bump into any tree or they would not land anywhere else.  in front of me I can see my partner going in front, and at the back, I can see someone holding me so that I can also go through that. Okay, great. Like, I can see the face of the person who is holding the camera, so it felt like I was held by a person only, not doing it solo. ",8,1,7,Speedflying,HVHA,4,2
"It was good. Yeah, it was chill, relax, and also like when we went to that boat or cruise, you can say, there I got the emotion of excited, because of the slide, yes, because of the slide. And later, I felt relaxed also, then when this screen comes, sunset, yeah, the sunset one, okay. I also felt excited while going up. ",8,1,8,InstantCaribbean,HVLA,4,2
"It was the first video and my first VR experience, so my mind was more focused on the vr technology than the earthquake itself. So the emotion was overall neutral. no strong emotions my mind was more focused on the technology and scenes itself not on the content.  I did realize what happened but I don't feel any I haven't felt any strong emotion.",9,2,1,NepalEarthquake,LVLA,3,3
"so it was not until very late that I realized this is a movie scene, and it's about this zombie apocalypse. Yeah, so I think it was more of neutral because it is a movie. Initially, I thought that, okay, it might be some video from a room or something like that, but I think after four, five seconds. but after like 10 to 20 seconds, I realized this is a movie scene, okay, then with the zombies and everything. I don't think I was scared or alert. The more curiosity was, what's going to happen and what's happening. ",9,2,2,ZombieApocalypse,LVHA,5,2
"This was nice, actually, it was. It was a positive experience. it was calm, the music as well as the building, nothing is happening and very calm music. You can look into the sky and just be calm and quiet there, and the music helped, yeah. ",9,2,3,AbandonedBuilding,LVLA,4,2
"It was more of a comedy than kidnapping. For me, it was more of a funny video.More like, okay, I'm playing a game and people are just acting.",9,2,4,Kidnapped,LVHA,5,2
"whenever it went down, I felt like it's tilting and everything.I felt scared. maybe because I'm scared of heights.
 The moment it went down and everything, so it felt like something is hapening. I was scared and excited. The eotion of the scared remained for the fall in the video and aterwards it was little ok.",9,2,5,MegaCoaster,HVHA,5,4
"It was a calm video. But then I think it went on too long. So I felt it was boring. yes, i love beaches. but I have never been to one.  yeah And so in the video I looked at the sun, I looked at the sea, I heard it, then what, for three minutes? And then I didn't know what to do. I thought it was way too long, okay.",9,2,6,MalaekahanaSunrise,HVLA,3,3
"This video it was a bit irritating because I didn't like dogs. Yeah, I don't like dogs in the place. So I was irritated. It was supposed to be a fun videos with pupies but I didn't felt so.",9,2,7,PuppiesHost,HVHA,3,3
"it was nice, the wave was nice, it's a high view, and as well as this wave sound of waves. I felt like I was not flying because I know that it's not like that, so it looked like ok. I think it was amusing. Calmness, as well as a bit exciting.",9,2,8,GreatOceanRoad,HVLA,5,2
"Well, I was intrigued. I was curious about the emotions of soldiers going to war, and the announcement about the Pearl Harbor attack. That was a little... the sort of change in attitudes of the people in that scenario, that was interesting to me. Overall, I'd say I was positively excited about the emotions and the portrayal of those emotions. But in terms of the actual subject matter, I'd say I had a negative emotion towards war in general. it’s more about that I was slightly annoyed for some of the part as why is it happening and where is it going on, when the CGI video was changing. Yes, it was a little confusing because I didn't quite know which side the actual thing was happening. And the fact that it kept switching from side to side confused me.",10,3,1,Warknownonation,LVHA,4,2
"I do not like this one because no not exactly irritated. I was .. like the intro was very .. I was hopeful that they walk amongst these, right? And it was just one 3D scene, and then it's there for 10-15 seconds, then it moves on slightly further ahead, maybe like 10 feet. no not exactly irritated. I was .. like the intro was very .. I was hopeful that they walk amongst these, right? And it was just one 3D scene, and then it's there for 10-15 seconds, then it moves on slightly further ahead, maybe like 10 feet. Yes, like it felt like, while the others kind of made me feel like I was a part of what was happening, this one made me feel like someone put me in front of a large screen, there's an image of the forest, and just told me to stand there and look around. I was disappointed.",10,3,2,Redwoods,HVLA,4,1
"I'd say this one made me feel a little ashamed and maybe a little guilty for being wasteful in my own life. Aside from that, in terms of the actual way it was shot, I feel this had me the most disconnected compared to other moving videos because first of all I could clearly see the apparatus used to shoot this video, the second thing that they were looking at something which was not present in the environment and they were distracted by that as everyone was looking at the camera which was shooting.",10,3,3,HappyLand,LVLA,3,3
"It was nice. I like the overall emotion that I felt from this. I felt excited, and I definitely felt like I want to do this someday. But again, I feel the camera was turned the other way around so you could see the person's face clearly. But then, if you look at the other way, like your point of view when you're doing this activity, there was like a line going straight down the middle, and you can tell it's two images being stitched together. And at some point, you could see when the angle changes a little, one image is first overlapping and then the second image overlaps. So that might have interfeared with my emotions.",10,3,4,Speedflying,HVHA,5,3
"Okay, so this is by far my favorite clip of all the ones that I was shown. And again, I'm picking... I mean, I'm just really like beaches. So, this is the one that spoke to me the most. : I wasn't thrown off. If there was no narration when they put you through the slide, I'd be really confused, like, hey, what's happening? But because they showed the slide and they said, ""Now you're gonna have a go,"" I knew to look around for where that light was. And it gave me the feeling that I was there. In addition to that, I feel this is the best shot and the exposure of the cameras because they're shooting directly into the sun. Felt that was the best. Like in the discovery clip, there was a shot where you could see the sun directly, and that was completely whited out. So, the trees were like you couldn't see all the detail in the trees near the top and that area was kind of like whited out. This one, they've taken care of the exposure. Yeah, and I feel this felt the most realistic to me. It was well made.",10,3,5,InstantCaribbean,HVLA,5,3
"Yeah, I mean, that's a very technical analysis, but I didn't really feel anything. See, it seemed like regular late-night TV.  I fet very neutral.  I like some of the perspectives they presented in this, but it definitely felt like they were trying to show that I was... that scenario, but it didn't really feel... It felt like a documentary, if I'm being honest. It's just a regular documentry.",10,3,6,Jailbreak,LVHA,2,4
"So, this one, I was confused. I didn't know exactly where to look and all that. But in terms of emotions, this played out pretty hard in that I felt bad. I felt a little ashamed. And in most of my responses, my, like, for ""proud,"" I'd marked three, four, or five. This one I've marked a little lower because I didn't feel... I felt very sad and ashamed that these types of scenarios are being created on an everyday basis. So, yeah, and the fact that this is some child's school and they've come back in the... The opening scene was very strong for me, and that's what set the tone for me throughout the video. I'd say even if it was maybe half the length of it, what it actually is, I feel the same emotion and the same intensity. Yeah, again, it wasn't a very strong emotion that I felt, but I could definitely sense.",10,3,7,TheDisplaced,LVLA,2,4
"So, these graphics, they didn't come through in the VR. The graphics that they added on top of the statistics. So, I spent a lot of the... First, like, it says ""Jullette Clinical."" I think that, and underneath that, they've written: ""Clinical."" I didn't quite... I wasn't able to read that. So,    Until he made the jump aside from 400 feet and 200 feet long rope, all I focused on was trying to read what was written there. But towards the end, I did enjoy it. I felt slightly disappointed because I was  I was expecting the person... Like, swing a little longer, but it just, like, was within the same area. A little disappointed.  They did, like, one minute or so build-up for something this small. I was like, okay. ",10,3,8,CanyonSwing,HVHA,5,3
"It was exciting. They were saying like you cannot go anywhere you should sit, stay in the car.mThe vision was little unclear.",11,4,1,Kidnapped,LVHA,5,3
"This video, felt like, not real.  Like, I was sitting all alone, no one was there. Maybe if someone was going here and there, then we would feel like that it is a beach, the real beach. Like the sunsetting was good. The video was somewhat relaxed and calm you can say.  ",11,4,2,MalaekahanaSunrise,HVLA,5,3
"Like it was not real to me, I have watched many zombie movies or web series, so like it was interesting to me. I was feeling like I was going with them and getting, like rescuing the other persons and then again coming back to the center.  yes interested, but I feel like I was going with them, but not in person. Like third view camera was going on here and there. I felt quite neutral like watching a show or a movie.",11,4,3,ZombieApocalypse,LVHA,5,3
" Emotions, I feel like I was a puppy with them. I felt this one was very unrealistic, the quality was not good. I don't have any pet or something else but I have seen videos. I don't like them too much.",11,4,4,PuppiesHost,HVHA,5,3
"This one, it felt like i was on a drone. Like it was good, like I was able to view, like all areas above, like from above, its a different view like you are on an aeroplane or something else. But like if i go on a swing, the cartwheel, it feels real. The height difference creates afraid- afraid or nervousness, but this didn't create anything. ",11,4,5,GreatOceanRoad,HVLA,5,3
"No emotion, nothing. Like we were sitting in the middle of the road and no one, only the wind is blowing and that, like what you say, the board is moving. Like i was, i am in a middle of a road and somewhere abandoned building and you see no one, no one to talk to, lonely. Yes it was a sad feeling. I felt Yes, lonely. ",11,4,6,AbandonedBuilding,LVLA,5,3
This one like whenever destruction is there we find like sadness or something. seeing the destruction made me feel sad. not guilty as in (not guilty) sad. ,11,4,7,NepalEarthquake,LVLA,5,3
"I felt some what afraid, somewhat afraid in this video. I was afraid in the starting but later it was little better when the slope was not there.",11,4,8,MegaCoaster,HVHA,4,3
"This one… so yeah, see since this was the first video and i was actually getting very familiar to the VR headset in the beginning, this was actually, seemed very, like it, I was actually present there in the moment, and i took i guess 32 seconds to be in there, and once i got, you know, once i got into that comfort, it was really fascinating to see what the video had played. I was not able to concentrate much on the content of the video and the emotion it induced. I felt quite fascinated about seeing a VR video.",12,1,1,TheDisplaced,LVLA,4,4
"emotions were, in the beginning excited, then i moved towards a subtle of, you know, something of like low emotions like you know feeling sympathy and empathy towards the children that was being shown on in the video. ",12,1,2,HappyLand,LVLA,3,4
"This one was actually my favorite. One, because the first thing that I saw in the video began by the prisoner escaping the jail, and then it was- the story was conveyed by how he made it outside the jail. And there were actually, you know, it was like the 360 camera was attached to his helmet or something like that, where i could see that he was actually, you know, removing his handcuffs and everything through which he was arrested and then actually moving through the stairs, going into the lift, that- it was actually looking like when i was in the lift it was so much like i was there, or looking at the cctv video of it in a very immersive way and after that he runs away and, you know, goes outside the prison. It was really amazing. the emotion was, you know, thrilling, or you know it was action and thrilling that wow this could be actually converted into a whole film or action or series, and it would be actually very much interesting.",12,1,3,Jailbreak,LVHA,4,4
"so emotions wise, it was okay, not too good. yeah. I pretty much honestly didn't get the story of this one, but other than that it was okay-ish. I didn't felt much emotion. ",12,1,4,Warknownonation,LVHA,3,3
"Yeah that was one of the best videos that i saw today because, you know, it was actually the 360 camera was mounted onto the helmet of the, you know, the climber and actually once he jumped in, i actually thought that i was in there and tied to a rope. It was really fascinating to see all the stone carvings and everything in 360, for example if i move my head the 360 camera also moves in that way, so i was actually thinking that i was present in the moment. it was adventurous, very much adventurous, that you know actually, I was there. It would be great if there was some sort of haptics technology as well, that i could you know hold the rope as well, but it was really, really amazing. yeah in this one i felt fear, i was actually a bit scared that i actually might fall down once, you know, the rope was left open into the, you know, in the video. ",12,1,5,CanyonSwing,HVHA,3,2
"it was calming basically, you know, kind of like in a meditation space, because of this the whole story i dont think was too much narrated, i dont remember, but it was okayish it was not too good. But it was mainly, for example if i am- if i use a VR headset in the morning, i maybe go to this or maybe expect something better out of the nature’s VR quality. Something like that, because it was not- it was calming and soothing but not more than that.",12,1,6,Redwoods,HVLA,3,2
"one was also very much intuitive and, you know, i felt a bit scared, once the, you know, the glider was reaching at the- once the glider was landing. So before that I was actually enjoying the view of the mountains and everything. I actually thought that I was gliding and, you know, gliding the parachute. For example if i tilt the head as well, i guess the camera was also rotating a bit. The head was actually very much synched and everything was nice in this, i like this. alking about the emotion, when i was landing on the glider i was a bit scared, and it seemed a bit adventurous in the beginning and then it seemed a bit dangerous, and once i was actually there i was actually enjoying that, i felt some sort of butterflies as well that i am actually at the top gliding a parachute.",12,1,7,Speedflying,HVHA,3,3
"This one was, firstly it was like watching a drone shot in the beginning of the sea, so it wasn't too much ,you know, very fun. I didn't have many feelings about it. It was just like watching a normal drone shot that was being taken up from the sea. After that once I went on to the ship it was like, you know, or the rides that were- the water rides, the boy and the girl that were taking up water rides, it was really good. Maybe not too much interesting or intuitive but it was okay. The emotion in this one was adventurous, maybe. And a bit of, not soothing, a bit scary, once the ride becomes- like i was traversing through the water, after that it doesn't interest me too.",12,1,8,InstantCaribbean,HVLA,4,4
"I felt upset, I felt very helpless, I wanted to like- I didn't want to be there but I was there, so I could feel the the loss that they have suffered. Probably they might have, like, they were telling that they have lost all their belongings, but I think they might have also lost their relatives, so i had a mix of emotions that will include helplessness, sadness, not guilty, literally, I never felt guilty because this is not something that we can stop. This is a natural cause.",14,2,1,NepalEarthquake,LVLA,3,3
"I felt Anxious! I don't know, my heartbeat, I could feel my heartbeats probably because it was very scared but, I think that this video also impacted a lot in raising my heartbeat. After 2020 I think life is uncertain and these are the things that I’m totally afraid of. I felt alertness and anxiety.",14,2,2,ZombieApocalypse,LVHA,4,4
"This one was very calm. I couldn't understand why we’re watching this, until and unless you started speaking. yeah this was calming, absolutely calming. However, I had a mixed emotion because I was thinking this first and second video had some sort of destruction, so it might also have something. I was ancipating something might happen. Otherwise it was calm.",14,2,3,AbandonedBuilding,LVLA,4,4
"This was more of a funny video, than an actual kidnap. Yeah I could understand that, but it was funny to me. It was something like our friends plan for our birthdays, yeah pranks. I was feeling that I have been kidnapped, but I was thinking probably this is a prank that they are doing. Okay so there was a scene where someone comes and knock the window, where and I got to know this is not the actual scene which is happening. It was funny.",14,2,4,Kidnapped,LVHA,4,4
"Ahh, this was actually very anxious. I was feeling like I’ll like- I was scared, I was feeling like I will fall or what if I fall from the chair itself, if not from the roller coaster, right? So this was anxious, mixed of emotion high heartrate and of course scared.",14,2,5,MegaCoaster,HVHA,5,5
"This was calming, I totally enjoyed it until- but I was scared that the person will come and attack me. The person sitting behind me. ",14,2,6,MalaekahanaSunrise,HVLA,3,5
"This one was a happy video. I sort of, I don't love dogs but I don't hate them. They are beautiful. i felt it was a happy video and you just wanted to know how we’ll react after watching all these sequence of videos, and nothing sort of afraidness, nothing of that sort.",14,2,7,PuppiesHost,HVHA,4,5
"This I loved. This is my favorite. This is something that I wanted to do and I was doing it virtually, so I loved it, absolutely. Exciting. I have always been a beach person so I just wanted to know where this place is, now I know. It’s on my bucket list now.",14,2,8,GreatOceanRoad,HVLA,5,2
"I was taken back to the people that get migrated from the countries, like those in Myanmar. I felt that I'm a privileged person and that i am living in the heart of a city, capital of india. Many people don't get that, they don't even have homes.",15,1,1,TheDisplaced,LVLA,4,3
"This was okayish, i didn't feel anything i was very neutral. The reason being that slum was the tour was shown we see such things.  it's just that the world we live in is very unfair and people have such things.",15,1,2,HappyLand,LVLA,4,3
"nothing i felt like i was watching a movie and something was about to happen but i couldn't know. yes I like, I wanted to get to know all of the movie but it was only three minute. No, it was just like a random movie didn't felt much. ",15,1,3,Jailbreak,LVHA,4,4
"emotion was those being at war, and people getting displaced because of that, and all the things that people feel during the time when their- any person from their family goes out at the front. A  bit towards negative, negative, sad, helpless. ",15,1,4,Warknownonation,LVHA,4,4
"I felt like that i, yeah I was a camera on top of the person that was going. So here I felt a little more in an elevated state. Also, I like all these adventure sports, so I liked the overall video. It was exciting.",15,1,5,CanyonSwing,HVHA,4,3
"oh this was very interesting. I like forests and trees in general, but I just felt like had there been any more people around. It was a little bit lonely. But overall the emotion was on positive side, calming. ",15,1,6,Redwoods,HVLA,4,3
"yeah, this one was also good. It was exciting, and I felt like I might get tipped from a tree or something. okay so it was mixed emotion, excitement plus fear. I think the music was very stereotypical, loud and like a game. In games we do like uphill rush and all, they have such audios. Had it been a more natural audio i would have liked it more. ",15,1,7,Speedflying,HVHA,4,3
"The emotions were positive. yeah narrator did help me, but the point where she says that now we will be going to the slide, she waited a long for a longer- I have to wait- I had to wait a long time for her to get inside the slide. The emotion was positive, but it have been more positive if the video was of better quality.",15,1,8,InstantCaribbean,HVLA,4,4
"Actually I am very close to nepal. And this was very upsetting for me because I have seen it when it happened n the news. A lot of people died in this. okay. So it was upsetting or sad, okay. I felt very strong emotions in this video.",16,2,1,NepalEarthquake,LVLA,2,4
This video was little funny to me. I first thought it was something related to world war. And then I realised it was abou zombies. It felt like they were acting. They were not real zombies.,16,2,2,ZombieApocalypse,LVHA,3,2
the background music was very calm but nothing happened in the video. So I didn't liked this video as much. This video was way too long. And it was still for so long. The background music was very good. But the voices and echo in the music was very kind of hard to understand. It elt like a typical motivational video.,16,2,3,AbandonedBuilding,LVLA,2,2
It was quite funny. There acting was very funny.  At first I felt it was not but then it felt like they are acting. The script was very funny actually. It was not shown in a serious way. It was shown in a funny way. ,16,2,4,Kidnapped,LVHA,3,3
"It is exciting. Yes, but when the rollercoster were dropping, I didn't feel that much. At first, when It  was happening, I felt like I was there, and when the drop happened, I felt even more connected to reality like it's actually happening, but that's not possible because physically I was here, so. At beginning it was more exciting, later on it was ok.",16,2,5,MegaCoaster,HVHA,4,2
"this video is very good, actually i love nature. Very, very relaxing. And as the sunset was slowly happening, and the changes in its light were occurring - there was a man sitting back there and I was watching that the sunlight falling on him, it was very, very beautiful. The experience of this was very good.  I felt like I was in front of the sea.",16,2,6,MalaekahanaSunrise,HVLA,5,1
This was cute. I don't have any pet but I like animals. It was a very very cute video.,16,2,7,PuppiesHost,HVHA,4,1
"This was my favorite video. I felt very very good. In this video, it was not only just exciting but also calm and very pleasant. It was really nice to see Australia from above, knowing that beneath is the sea, it was very, very good. Like, I have actually done paragliding, and I really want to come here and do paragliding. ",16,2,8,GreatOceanRoad,HVLA,5,2
"the emotion was as, it was the first video. There was also a little bit of confusion as to what is happening, and besides that for the content of the video, i was kind of a little scared also, because it felt like war and they were scenes of radio announcements and people first dancing and then stopping to listening to listen to the announcements etc. So yeah, also anticipation as to what was about to happen, so yeah. Also I felt kind of stuck. because i could not move around but i could see people moving around me. So there were people running but i could not run, so yeah.",17,3,1,Warknownonation,LVHA,3,4
"i felt like it was interesting that i got to see this in VR because i have never experienced such woods in real life. So that was it, and also it was also a little bit curious that something can be experienced to such an extent to VR, so that was also what i was feeling while watching this. yeah that something, somebody can be sitting in their chair, in their house and could be feeling like they are in the woods surrounded by such huge trees. yeah it felt kind of calming, and also interesting that now that i had already seen one video, i felt like okay the emotions are changing. So that was my personal perception for that, but yeah it felt calming and it felt nice to be surrounded by nature after the war scenes.",17,3,2,Redwoods,HVLA,4,3
" it was kind of sad, and it was also that one of these questions was guilty, so i felt kind of guilty watching this, that there are so many children and they are so helpless and they live in swamps and all these slums etc and we cannot do anything for them, and yet these children seemed happy and one of the girl answered that happiness is for the people of happy land or something like that, so yeah. That was kind of sad so yes. yeah it was more comfortable because people were also moving and there was no need to run around, so i could just stand and watch. Didn't felt stuck. yes kind of sad, kind of guilty, and also that a little bit hopeful that there were people there that were there to help them, but yeah. yeah it kind of felt weird. There was a moment at which a child was pointing, so yeah it kind of felt like it was pointing at me, but not discomfort, but in like, curious.",17,3,3,HappyLand,LVLA,2,4
"this was exciting and also like- I felt little bit adventurous after watching this and also i felt like i was smiling the whole time, so yeah. it was nice. it was a cheerful and happy, exciting video.  It had this thing that i was feeling stuck, now it was constantly moving so i felt active this time.",17,3,4,Speedflying,HVHA,5,5
"I know that it was supposed to be relaxing, but i didn't feel relaxed after watching this. i dont know why, because maybe it was the scene that they put us into the slides, or maybe that i was not moving around as much, or i dont know… The scenes were not pleasurable to watch, i did not like it. The narrator it was like she was announcing my emotions to me that you should be feeling nice because you are on this. it was like an advertisement, more so. So she was telling the slides are fun and everything is nice, the the food is nice and everything is nice, but it did not feel so because i did not experience it. I actually felt like getting off the boat. ",17,3,5,InstantCaribbean,HVLA,3,2
"this was new, because it was a totally different experience, so yeah. I felt in, like i was interested to know whether the person gets away with it or not, so yeah that was new and also it was a jail setting which you rarely experience, so that was also new. so yeah it felt nice, but at this point also, i had a slight headache so that was a problem, but otherwise the video was interesting. no i did feel guilty, because it was from i think at some points it was from a second person view, as if something was handed and something the things were getting handed to the person and i was watching it, but also at other scenes- in the scenes that he was trying to unlock the handcuff. yeah I felt nervous that maybe i will get away with it and maybe i will not, and also i did feel guilty in the scenes like the policeman or whatever was bringing food and was like the plates were being handed out. So yeah i did feel like i was guilty, so- and also i felt a little bit scared in between where a new person comes in and he's being yelled at, somewhat. ",17,3,6,Jailbreak,LVHA,3,4
"it was sad, definitely sad. Also, it was a little bit confusing because these people were talking in a language which i did not understand, and i realized it later but subtitles were coming but they were not in the direction that i was looking at. So when i turned i did see the dialogues. I was able to read them and it was sad that this is happening and it is also a present day situation, so yeah it felt like these people might be going through this right now, so yeah i did feel guilty and sad at the same time.  yeah, in one particular scene, in which the children were playing in the dialogues- because they were talking in ukrainian i did not understand but then i turned around and saw that the subtitles were there, but either i could read them or i could look at the children, so it was a little confusing.",17,3,7,TheDisplaced,LVLA,1,4
"yeah this was very adventurous and very scary, because i think i am afraid of heights and suddenly i was thrown off a cliff so yeah.  yeah they were telling how high the cliff is and everything so it was nice. i was expecting them to throw me off at any point and suddenly they did, so yeah that was scary. The person was yelling and i felt like yelling with him. Haan because all of a sudden i was thrown off, and then i did understand, okay, this is VR and i dont have to shout, but yeah it did feel interesting being thrown off. i dont know i controlled my emotion at that point, or maybe i did not feel like- it was instantaneous, i felt like okay i am being thrown off.",17,3,8,CanyonSwing,HVHA,2,5
"okay i was not expecting something so intense all of a sudden. Actually i wasnt expecting, i don't know what sort of videos i was expecting, but not this for sure. So i was kind of shocked, but like i said, i have experience on it, so i knew that this is not a real thing that is happening, so i wasn’t that scared. But i was interested like where is gonna go, and the kidnappers didnt really seem that serious also, it wasn’t that scary. so it was shocking, but not- i was not scared. it was negative for sure, like i wasn't happy seeing this. In general i was not happy, but i was interested in like where is this gonna go, like, i like a story line in a video. yeah, like i said like, i got to know that this is not a serious kidnapping, like these people are not that serious about it. So i was like okay, i was then kind of chill about it. yeah i was shocked, i was confused, i thought these people were like first playing a prank or something, like they were like a game and there they are friends, but then once we got into the car i was like okay, okay now i want to know where this is going here.",18,4,1,Kidnapped,LVHA,3,4
"okay i enjoyed this a lot. I am anyway- i love the beach, okay, like its the place that brings me like a lot of calmness. At first i was like, kind of alert, like in that question because i thought something was going to happen, because after the first video, i thought in the second video something is gonna happen like some jump scare or someones gonna come or something will happen. anticipation. i think it took me like around 30 40 seconds, I'm like okay this is a video, nothing will happen. Yeah, so then i was very calm and i like then i just enjoyed it through. yeah yeah no i literally told myself like i am at a beach right now. relax, chill, just like be in the water that's it. yeah i felt exactly the same in fact like I am in beach.",18,4,2,MalaekahanaSunrise,HVLA,5,1
"oh this one, I was kind of uncomfortable when the zombies showed up. At first i didn't know it was a zombie apocalypse. That happened a bit later. confused, yeah. i thought we were in a mental asylum or something, or like murder was going on, i don't know. i thought these people were- okay these people were killing them, but i thought why they shooting like innocent people? okay like zombie apocalypse toh- because i don't watch zombies and all that, i thought this was like an army camp and like terrorist have come. at the starting i was like, like okay what is going on? Like i just generally dont like. I was like I don't want to be here. in the sense i was not even listening to them also, i was just thinking about what i’ve been doing. later on when they actually started shooting people I didn't like it, i was distressed. At end I realized they were zombie to I felt a little chill. yeah especially the gun shots, that's when i got to like, this- like they are actually shooting them.  i will be very distressed and upset and just angry and why are they shooting innocent people. I disliked it completely.",18,4,3,ZombieApocalypse,LVHA,2,4
"oh i love this, this was my favorite video. It was like instant happiness, yeah. the moment you saw them, I was instant happy. I love puppies in real life.  i just wish it was more up, in line with the puppies or like the humans actually. Otherwise I was happy.",18,4,4,PuppiesHost,HVHA,5,2
"honestly i was very neutral in this. i was like what is going on, and then i was like okay, i first thought i was in a helicopter, i think because of the audio but then i was looking around and there was no like helicopter sort of thing around me. i was very neutral, like i do enjoy such places.  I enjoyed this. I was happy and then i was calm. yeah once i got to know like this is the only thing that will happen, i was like okay this is nice and i didn't know was Australia.  i think because i was moving so unnaturally.  i was confused- i thought it was my vision that got blur first. Like for like one second i thought. But otherwise it was a nice video.",18,4,5,GreatOceanRoad,HVLA,4,2
"I was very bored in this, very. because nothing was happening.  yeah I was waiting for something to happen. I was feeling sllepy watching this. yeah I think i even closed my eyes, I was like okay nothing is going to happen, and i was not listening to the person in the background audio also.  initially when i was expecting something to happen, i thought someone or something will come or something, i dont know. And i think this is the longest video, it took me to realize like nothing will happen. yeah i think there was like a crinkly sound also, thats when i thought like someone is coming or something is happening, but it was just the wind. ",18,4,6,AbandonedBuilding,LVLA,4,2
"oh i dont like it. i find these videos very, like, sad. And i completely forgotten about like the earthquake, happened long ago so it like reminded again- I didnt like it. yeah exactly. like i was not calm, i do not like- as soon as like the earthquake thing happened i was like no no, i don't want to watch this because these things just make me upset. but it was nice seeing- like i really like seeing so many people coming and helping, like aiding the people who suffered the loss. ",18,4,7,NepalEarthquake,LVLA,2,4
" i loved it i love roller coasters in general and i've been on this one. yeah. familiarity, but so this was pretty shocking though because in the sense, i'll explain, so like on my VR i tried a roller coaster simulator, but that was all like animated, so i never felt anything. i was like this is so childish. And I'm a huge roller coaster fan in general, so this was the first time i actually felt like i was in it, like i could like physiologically feel like okay I'm taking turn- yeah my heartbeat was… and i don't know there's this one feeling, not even nausea, like something happening in my stomach but in a good way, like in an excited way. excitement yeah, i did not want the video to finish.",18,4,8,MegaCoaster,HVHA,5,5
"I was a bit confused, because I could not understand which war they are relating to and like what... I wasn't able to understand, like was it World War One or World War Two or something else? So, a bit of confusion on that part, but yeah, overall the video experience was great. Like in there, instances when the soldiers are aspirating in front of me, so I felt like I'm just standing there and they are... They are like, moving around. So, I kind of felt that I was in that particular scene in this moment. Otherwise, like after I came back to reality... When I took my headset back, I kind of... Restabilized to everything, like, this wasn't anymore in my mind that, okay, I was there or something else. I would say it was moderately positive experience. Like, I was able to... I enjoyed the experience, but afterwards, I wasn't able to, like, feel anything. Like, after the video ended, it didn't leave an impact on me. like if the audio wasn't there, I might have been more confused than I am right now.",19,3,1,Warknownonation,LVHA,4,4

There is just scenes after scene. So, nothing much. It was neutral. No, not really I don't like forests. I am more of a city guy. I felt afraid because I was alone. But if I wasn't alone, then I would not have been afraid, because there are other people around me. I was a slight afraid because I knew I am in Virtual Reality. Yeah, like slow video as in it was not as dynamic as the previous video where they're shifting a lot more and there are people moving around. It's more static, that I'm just standing.",19,3,2,Redwoods,HVLA,2,2
"A bit depressing, I would say. They are showing the situation of poor people in the Philippines. So, I, like the kids, like the kids over there, and then, at the end, they showed the girls singing for them, so that was good. But otherwise, it was a bit depressing, like they're showing sad kids with the... like, a background voice that she... like, tells me something- narration. It was more like a movie. Like, I wasn't present there physically, but yeah, at times when they just... like, there's a 10-second scene and I can just move around and see all around me, that time, in that transition, I can feel that, okay, probably I am just in that particular scene, but if I'm just sitting in one position, then it's like a movie.",19,3,3,HappyLand,LVLA,2,2
"I think I felt a bit afraid when the person just dived off the cliff. And I wasn't able to understand what's happening until I moved around and saw the person gliding. I had to move, otherwise, it felt like a drone shot. I had a drone is shooting this and I'm watching it, but when I just move back and see the person is gliding, so that kind of felt like, okay, I'm actually gliding now in the air, otherwise, it felt like drone shot. But later, I wouldn't say afraid. I think I would say excited. I was afraid at the point when he was just, like, he just dropped off the cliff. But after that, I felt excited. yeah like but if i moved up i see a parachute above me, see down i see legs and then move backwards i see the person, so then i realized that okay its not a drone shot, then i got into that scenario- or yeah the music, if they removed the music it would have been better.",19,3,4,Speedflying,HVHA,5,4
"the narration i think it killed it off, like it felt like an advertisement.  like when she speaking i am not able to feel anything, but when she stops speaking and she gives time, like just explore on, then i kind of feel that okay i am in that scene, yeah. no, experience was good, just in those moments when she is speaking i kind of feel that okay this is not a reality because someone is speaking. I didn't felt much in the cruise. I was little excited in the beach.",19,3,5,InstantCaribbean,HVLA,5,1
"i was able to feel that it was a vr when he's like picking his lock, but otherwise it felt like a normal video when they show that he actually running out of the jail. yeah it felt like a movie when they are showing when he is moving out of the jail cell and then he braks- like pushes the guards away and then moves to the staircase, that felt like the movie but when they are giving pov shots when the guy is entering the jail and when he's picking the lock of his handcuffs, that felt like real. it was exciting like exciting yeah, that somethings about to happen.",19,3,6,Jailbreak,LVHA,5,5
"So this felt like immersive because i was given time to like explore around, what's happening. there was not much narration like kids are just roaming around on the building, so it felt like i am  standing on the building terrace and there are kids around me and they are rooming around. so it felt- it felt kind of real. I was a bit distressed, like seeing the all- all this destruction. yeah because it allowed me,, to like explore the whole space before moving on to the next scene, like it felt real that this actually happened somewhere. The ukraine part i liked more than the sudan part the- the sudan part felt like a movie, the ukraine part where they just taking still shorts and allowed explore, move around, that felt like real this happened. I was able to sympathize and relate.",19,3,7,TheDisplaced,LVLA,2,4
"eah so there was a bit of a glitch in between, that it kind of stopped running when just at the moment when he dives off the cliff there is a glitch. otherwise this was- i felt a fear emotion when they are at the like, edge of the cliff and they say that okay now you’re at the edge, i look down and it felt like my feet were there but after he jumped it felt like he is just swinging.  yeah i didn't feel that. like probably if i was swinging along in reality, then i would have felt that okay something is happening. It was very realistic.",19,3,8,CanyonSwing,HVHA,4,4
"yeah i mean initially i thought i just have to look in one place but i- i soon realize that you can just see anything anywhere. I was just curious of what was going on nothing as emotional response, like i was scared or, no i mean there was nothing in the video that that triggered any sort of emotional response. I felt I was there but no extreme response, I was neutral. yeah i mean that the acting of kidnappers was also sort of funny it doesnt seem like a very intense situation, maybe due to their acting also.",20,4,1,Kidnapped,LVHA,4,2
"It was a very calming video.  it felt like you just looking and sitting at a beach, looking at sunset or sunrise, it was cool. I like beaches. yeah i mean after- after a certain duration it felt like you were actually sitting at a beach so you kind of delve into the video, that i was being shown so at starting- as the time went by it starting more like you are sitting in a beach and watching sunset.",20,4,2,MalaekahanaSunrise,HVLA,5,2
"so it felt like that you are a part of the movie itself. i mean running with the team, running from the zombies. Emotion was very exciting and alert. it felt like that i mean I was a part of that of the team yeah.",20,4,3,ZombieApocalypse,LVHA,5,2
okay this one yeah this was a very relaxed video. I like dogs somewhat. the audio was funky. it kept me engaged. I was just looking around what is happening. I was relaxed.,20,4,4,PuppiesHost,HVHA,4,2
"I think it was the one in which we were flying over the canyon, this was actually good its like you are sitting in a helicopter. i mean although the noise wasn't there, but you actually feel like your floating about the whole scene, so that was actually good. I mean- it felt great, but not the calming type thing, but i mean it felt good hovering over the whole scene. It was little exciting.  ",20,4,5,GreatOceanRoad,HVLA,4,2
"neutral I would say. eah, i was trying to listen to the speech but i think at some point. so it was relaxed after certain point, i mean after i realize that nothing is happening in that video then i mean yeah i can say relaxed. yeah as compared to other videos it felt a little bit boring.",20,4,6,AbandonedBuilding,LVLA,4,2
"yeah so in this they talked about the earthquake what happened and it seemed like a documentary, i mean you could actually feel that you are in that environment seeing all that tragedy and all that devastation. yes response, such, like i was feeling sympathy and the pain, the tragedy that happened there. I felt a litlle sad. yeah i mean it's more intense than just seeing it on the news. see it and be in that environment. I could feel the pain of those people. I have seen earthquake kind of tragedy.",20,4,7,NepalEarthquake,LVLA,4,2
"it was very exciting, i mean you could in this you actually feel like you are sitting on a roller coaster. like going down the roller coaster, so i mean yeah i feel the thill, a little light in my legs also, so yeah it was a very thrilling experience.",20,4,8,MegaCoaster,HVHA,4,2
"um generally i felt a bit sad because the way it was just left around, meant nobody wanted to sort of fix it. These kinds of things happen with disasters, but in this case i think they mentioned war as the reason, and like war doing that and no one fixing it means the war was the reason the people were displaced. So usually war is about the resources of a region. Typically it's like occupying the place or something like that, so this is just like i felt a bit weird about just the whole thing happening because it felt like war for the sake of just using weapons and using war. yeah I ffelt a little negative and a little like i couldn't explain why someone would just leave it and go somewhere else. while watching the video it was just sort of like taking in the situation and thinking about like how nobody was there, and things like that.",21,1,1,TheDisplaced,LVLA,3,3
"I could relate to the narrator, so she said we can't really help but we can bring it up as a- as a tourist location and try to create awareness in people, that there are places like this where there's no scope for making- improving the place and i think she also mentioned the town was very close but they still wouldn't get the resources from the town, and so i- i could sort of, i felt a little upset because like a little upset because they were- the town is very close, means like they had access to at least human resources, so they could have used them for like any kind of human labour based activity, but they didn't. So i felt like it was their responsibility to assign things to them. I was thinking about all this. I think the enthusiasm was sort of like, necessary for the person who was doing the job because other than the tourist validation, the person didn't have anything motivating in terms of what they were showing, like they were just sort of showcasing poverty so it helped, but i- i was sort of like, i had my own thoughts about the poverty so i felt like the narration didn't coexist with my thoughts. i feel like i was immature, i feel like i should have been able to take the narrative and sort of create. yeah i felt- yeah like it became worse because of that, because i felt like the narration was going along well with how i was thinking about it. .",21,1,2,HappyLand,LVLA,3,3
"so this one, this one was the most exciting for me. the story. i was anticipated- like i was just curious about how he would break out of prison, i, like i just wanted to sort of think about how- like he could have planned it and how the, the guards weren't aware enough of the fact that he actually did escape and things like that. movie definitely movie. i don't know if it is because the- this is the only context I've seen earlier, like so jailbreak and movies are the only context i know in terms of jailbreaking.",21,1,3,Jailbreak,LVHA,2,1
"this one, so there were parts of it where it was zooming into the image, yeah the transitions, i felt like the transitions could have had a better effect on my brain, but it didn't. Like they were pretty normal, but i feel like VR can make those transitions a bit more, better. i don't know exactly how, like i don't want it to affect anything neurological, but i thought in a cinema theatre if those kinds of transitions happen they would be a bit more dramatic. maybe it was the music, maybe it was- so i felt like in this one the transitions were there just for me to notice it, but not like cinematic value. oh this one I had to be, like, calculating. yeah, neutral. I- it was about, so at first, the people standing there, their clothes kept changing, so I thought that had something to do with their positions, their titles and their sort of war context. this one felt like a documentary, not like a movie, but a documentary where they were sort of explaining each and every time. what would be my emotional response to war… indifference. I was thinking logically.",21,1,4,Warknownonation,LVHA,3,2
"so this one was exciting, I felt fear. yeah, I felt fear. I am a little scared of heights; this one was pretty good in terms of that. I expected a trajectory with it like a bit more, and then maybe going to the other cliffs and then holding on to it or something like that, and it was just like a little bit of. okay, it's like sky diving, it's like the diving is the hardest part, but after that, you are like having fun so. It started with me being sared. But its was little less scary in the end.",21,1,5,CanyonSwing,HVHA,5,4
"familiarity, I've been here. so I have hiked here at least 10 times. so it was highly correlated. yeah, nostalgia. first thing i wanted to do was look up to see how big the red wood trees are because they are known to be like the tallest trees there. yeah, i was missing it, i was sort of thinking about being there. I made sure I wasn't sad. yeah yeah i was just happy that like people from Delhi sort of work with data that reminds me of a place I've lived in. yeah VR usually means there is a purpose to the VR content that is created, and here i felt like it was just sort of being around nature. that was the only context, and for that i think i should be there, like i expected smell i expected like the environment the atmosphere, maybe some animal sounds, those things weren't there, so it was like I would rather be actually there than in this video.",21,1,6,Redwoods,HVLA,5,3
"this one was fun. there were a few friends of mine who asked me for ask me to go to ski trips with them and but i never did in my life, so like this one was a bit sad for me because i could have actually done this in my life and i didn't, but i was happy with the video because this one was like, what virtual reality is supposed to do. so i felt happy. yeah i was just that sort of enthusiastic jock or something. Okay so it started with enthusiasm and then gone to regret.",21,1,7,Speedflying,HVHA,5,4
"I hated this one. because this is an advertisement and a poor one.  like they used VR to advertise the Caribbean in terms of tourism, and they didn't even sort of do any of the things that would make it exciting. like it- it tried to show, they tried to show the island but they didn't show it, the water tube didn't start at the right time. yeah I feel like the video itself is meant to be frustrating, like don't use vr actually go there sort of video, but i don't understand it because like even if I google the Caribbean i probably find pictures and videos of people from planes showing the whole island showing everything, so i feel like the intent of the video is to frustrate people. ",21,1,8,InstantCaribbean,HVLA,1,2
"it was a bit stressing video, and so i was actually present in that video experiencing almost everything that was happening so it was a bit stressing i think, and yeah that was it i think. no it was not similar i think this was, if i were in a natural setting actually present there then would have been much stronger, the feelings would have been much stronger. i think i would have felt more scared if i had actually be there, more pity for these people. I was a bit scared as well not that strongly because i know its a VR headset that i am watching that video on, it's not actually present. ",22,2,1,NepalEarthquake,LVLA,2,3
"yeah i was not able to understand what was happening there, i thought this was probably a game setting that i usually play, this first-person setting. yeah i think initially i was not able to understand the conversation, after i was looped in i was- i thought that there some kind of confusion regarding this army camp and then they are either evacuating people or they are hurting them, they are torturing them, they- there's some kind of war going on and they are actually attacking the people of the other side when they were killing these people, so i was actually relating this to all the games that i usually play. emotion was, was actually it feels very embarrassing to say that i was almost excited to be a part of this situation because the kind of games that i have been playing, i don't think that- yeah i don't think i have ever been scared of these guns and the music that, in fact i- it's a much more enriching experience if you have good headphones on and the gunshots sounds are more.",22,2,2,ZombieApocalypse,LVHA,3,2
"yeah it was a bit scary, it seemed a bit lonely. the music effect made it worse i think and the- i think there was a cloth piece that was hanging there and it seemed like it was a bit abandoned place that you know something bad had happened there. so it felt like i had to be there because something bad had happened to me, but i was left alone there. It was a bit scary. yeah initially i understood the whole situation of the video, but then i felt like that i was almost sitting there, just you know hearing the sound of the wind hissing through my ears and going through my thoughts i was not actually watching the video, i was moved into the thoughts that were coming in my mind.",22,2,3,AbandonedBuilding,LVLA,2,2
"I didn't think- I don't think I felt much here because the kind of words that he was throwing at me were not very relatable in a scary way, it was mostly relatable in a very, you know, action movie way- that I am watching a movie so it was a bit exciting as well in a certain way, but not scary not much scary. at one moment it was a bit scary but i think the kind of language they were using it was not very scary. I think the moment they were driving me towards- this was the moment the setting of this car is a bit frightening, and then they actually park their car at the end when they were talking to some person, their boss probably, that was the moment i think the setting, yeah the setting okay so this was a bit frightening. i was not confused i was very sure this is a kidnapping video and i am the person- it was a pov of the person that is being kidnapped but when they were actually pointing gun towards me it was not scary. it should have been scary i would have been scared but the the people that were trying to scare me were not good enough with their job.",22,2,4,Kidnapped,LVHA,3,3
"this was the typical video that i expected from a vr headset, yeah it was perfectly aligned, it felt nice and the audio was great as well. it was exciting. and a bit afraid as well. initially a bit afraid and when usually the roller coaster goes down this is i feel a bit jittery, there is some butterflies in my stomach that i feel from what i have experienced previously, i have not been to an amusement park since a long time but that is usually what i feel, and this reminded me of that feeling. I think it was- if the resolution would have been a bit better it felt almost realistic the- with the head movement going along with the roller coaster, it was- it was nice it was pretty great in fact. yeah at a particular point i felt that there was some dizziness but for very, very brief seconds i think one or two seconds i felt when the roller coaster was moving a lot. there was a change- as the roller coaster you know made it more exciting, the emotions swayed that way. initially, it was a bit calm when the roller coaster was taking its pace and later it- with the noises that were around, the people shouting for because of the roller coaster became too much speedy, that was the moment that elicited some strong emotions but when the roller coaster was settling, taking its position to offload the people, that was a bit felt a bit calm.",22,2,5,MegaCoaster,HVHA,5,4
"yeah, i felt it was a sunrise because with the video going forward, i think the sun actually. I felt a bit lonely here because there was nobody else on the beach, I've never been on a such beach before. yeah this is a very quiet beach, nobody is around. There is usually a lot of hustle on the beaches, shacks on my behind, people drinking and eating and you know clicking their pictures, playing in the water. it was not very much like the beaches that i have seen before, but yeah it seemed a bit calming as well. initially, it was- i felt that it could have been a bit boring as well but i think the sun made a lot of progress in three minutes of the video so it wasn't that boring. It was calming and lonely. it's not about being realistic, it's about being a very new experience. yeah it does seem realistic, i have been to such places where there were less people on the beach, but we didn't prefer going to those beaches because it was not very lively.",22,2,6,MalaekahanaSunrise,HVLA,3,1
"this was a very wholesome video, i actually love dogs so yeah it seemed very nice. it was a very wholesome experience, being actually- this felt like i was almost at the levels of these puppies so either i was the breadcrumb they were playing with, or a dog itself, not moving obviously. yeah it felt like I could actually you know, play with everything around. these puppies are playing with, i could mingle with them as well, the way they are you know playing with each other, felt like i was at their level, I would perform the level of action they do. obviously, i was not, i was just sitting there so yeah. yes, it was a new experience, it was a very cute experience. ",22,2,7,PuppiesHost,HVHA,5,1
"it was very calming i think. i thought initially that it would feel lonely again like that beach but it didn't. it was a bit exciting as well, looking at that sand from that level, so yeah it was adventurous. yeah i felt like i was paragliding, so it didn't matter how the perspective- if i closer to the ground or closer to the sky, just depends on the height I am flying yeah the perspective completely made sense.",22,2,8,GreatOceanRoad,HVLA,4,3
"I felt like there should be no war and war leads to development of technology. It was a neutral emotion. I think it was a first-person experience. so i was- i felt like okay i am also a part of the scene. so we have not been in war directly or actively, but seeing the condition of the people who have been in war, or who have first hand experiences of war, we feel that war should not take place. But I have a objective reaction to it.",23,3,1,Warknownonation,LVHA,4,3
"It was a peaceful experience. Sometimes transitions were not obvious, I didn't know that the transition had happened, it was somewhat immersive but yes, at some points you can feel the transition is happening, yeah, it did not affect the emotion, but it made me realize the scene has changed. It was calming and relaxed.",23,3,2,Redwoods,HVLA,5,4
"sad, slightly sad. Yes, there was a lady. Some people came, she took them on a tour of the slum, maybe they came for the project, and they were making a video. Then they meet a girl, ask her some questions, and later they sing a song. no it feel like we are a part of the scene, i would feel children are standing around me sometimes it also felt like they are looking up to you, because they are short and then- yes you can look around. ",23,3,3,HappyLand,LVLA,4,3
"I was excited, it was adventurous. I was not scared at all. I felt like I enjoyed this video overall. The music was good, I liked the video.",23,3,4,Speedflying,HVHA,5,4
"This video was very good, happy emotions were there. I like beaches very much. starting it was very good and end was very good, but in the between when we are near the bar counter it was not good as in it normal.  yeah so it felt like i went to a tour company, so that i can book my tour, they gave me vr set and they are making me experience that this is all you can do if you go on this trip. And at the end I realised it was the end of the video. ",23,3,5,InstantCaribbean,HVLA,5,4
"It was interesting video. POV, it felt like I am looking from above in this, in some places from above, in some places, it feels like a first-person perspective.  it feels like i am a part of a movie scene. Yes, they were explaining to him that someone has come to meet you, they will take you to the judge, these are your documents, read them. He receives them and does something and then in the end he run away.",23,3,6,Jailbreak,LVHA,4,3
"It was a little sad video. In the last video you're not directly seeing the adverse effects of the war in it, it's like you're in the war, action is happening right now, action has already happened here. Now you are seeing the repercussions of the war. Because even on the roof, shells are lying there. ",23,3,7,TheDisplaced,LVLA,3,3
"I felt one thing in it, I mean, it felt alright, but one thing logically seemed to me that the rope is so far, how am I hanging in the middle now? I didn't understand that thing, everything else was fine. Yeah, when I started hanging, I was thinking how can I hang in the middle because it looks very far away. In the beginning, I felt excited, ready to jump, and then I knew I had to go there, but I couldn't understand if I would hang or if it's like holding onto the rope and going there like that, but when I jumped, I realized that I think it's kind of like hanging. Or when it said that the distance is 400 feet and the rope is 200 feet, then I realized that you're going to hang, I realized a little bit, but yeah, the logic wasn't clear how we hung in the middle all of a sudden.",23,3,8,CanyonSwing,HVHA,5,4
"I was kind of sad. Yeah, it was mostly sad and sympathy. I was feeling bad. I am just kind of seeing those children in front of me . so it’s kind of more of a something is happening right in front of me so this was making me sad. I was kind of having not a good mood. I’ve not experienced this personally, neither have I met someone who had experience so everything I know is from news and documentaries. It felt stressful.",24,1,1,TheDisplaced,LVLA,2,4
"It was also emotional, not as sad as the war video where displaced children were shown but yes, there was a factor of sadness seeing the situation of those children and those people. So in this video I can see some volunteers working it gives a hope that something is happening or will happen. But in the previous video the visuals very very destructive like as I’m standing in a war struck area. I have a little bit exposure of to these slum areas where i have interacted with people who work for the upliftment of the underprivileged. The emotion I can say was, sad but with bit of hope.",24,1,2,HappyLand,LVLA,1,3
I felt kind of scary and thrilled like what is going to happen next. The video was immersive. It felt little sacry and like I was there. ,24,1,3,Jailbreak,LVHA,1,4
it was again sad and kind of a little stressful thinking about what happened to these people and families. So yes sad and stressful. The emotions were formed in first scene itself when they talked about war. yeah it was like movie like I’m watching movies on war kind of feeling. Like you feel sad in movies but you know it’s a movie.,24,1,4,Warknownonation,LVHA,1,3
"It was definitely not sad. Kind of the feeling that you get when you are doing some adventure sport or you are out on a holiday. You and your group of friends are going out for an adventure sport, you are watching somebody doing something which is very thrilling. at few time I felt  like maybe if the rope breaks at that  time i was like what is going to happen? But then it was not at all sad. It was very very litle scary. I had very little motion sickness. The time that man just started the swing, yeah, the sudden transition. Like you are just moving at a very fast pace, but only during that time.",24,1,5,CanyonSwing,HVHA,2,3

"It was adventurous. The audio was good and natural. Like, I felt okay, so it was something real going on. So, it was kind of that kind of audio and video. It was only excitement. Like nothing sad, not like thrill. I didn't have that sense that something bad might happen, which gives you a sense of scariness.",24,1,7,Speedflying,HVHA,3,3
"Happy. It was as if I felt like going on a vacation after seeing this video. It was good, happy, calmingYes, it was good. Like there was a sudden transition from look at the sunset  to a bar  and then again to some ride . so it was good. Like keeping up the excitement.  it was good . it seem like it was an advertisement or publicity for maybe a holiday package or some cruise or something. But I felt happy after watching this video.",24,1,8,InstantCaribbean,HVLA,5,1
"I did not like it.  I just felt that I was physically present there, but not at that place. But somewhere above, just visualising everything from a top place. Like I was standing up. I just saw a few videos related to these earthquakes that recently happened. I was just, like, I saw the similarity of these cases. It felt like a documentry.",25,2,1,NepalEarthquake,LVLA,3,3

"Okay. The third one was abandoned building. So, I have been to such places because I like being alone. So, I usually visit places like being and just see and look around. Okay. So, the emotion was... emotion was just, I was just curious, looking around. Curious.. No, I was just like curious, let me look around, what is there. I enjoyed teh ecperience.",25,2,3,AbandonedBuilding,LVLA,4,3

"It was a roller coaster, very uncomfortable. Yeah, to be correct, but in general also, I'm not very comfortable going on, so I mean, the similar to be in that place and I am going around. It was a negative experience. I was expecting it to be ok, for something initially, then when I saw that it is uncomfortable, but in starting I enjoyed, but then it went round and round. I felt a little nauseous.",25,2,5,MegaCoaster,HVHA,2,4
"It was good. It was very pleasant. All those emotions that I had of unpleasant experiences after watching the last video of rollercoaster, like, during I was watching this video, like, everything went away, and I was just calm. I felt positive while watching this.",25,2,6,MalaekahanaSunrise,HVLA,5,1

"I was scared. I was terrified. Like people are fighting, it's burning everywhere. Yeah, people were running from someplace, I think there was war. Basically, like people are fighting, so I am a bit terrified. Like okay, things are not normal. The CGI graphics made it more terrifying. So yeah, there was a dance video in between. I felt a bit relaxed, but then, yeah, it was not that pleasant. No, not much, but yeah, I was—I seen people were in a plane and they were, like, trying to escape. So that was also making me more terrified. I felt like I am also a part of that war that's going on, and I am also suffering from it, basically. ",26,3,1,Warknownonation,LVHA,2,5
"It was pleasant because I like nature, and I like to be a part of that. I was relaxed in this video. Yeah, it was peaceful, the sounds of birds and all. I was just relaxed and calm. I was feeling very peaceful. I was in the woods, I was on the bridge as well, so it was all the same. It's like I am in the woods and I am enjoying the nature. ",26,3,2,Redwoods,HVLA,5,1
"I was feeling bad for people. We are very privileged, and this is also a reality that we have not seen. I have never been to slum area. But we see it's like that only like, everywhere. Like, major emotion was, like, I was feeling sad for them, and I was like, this is also life that people are living somewhere. I was thinking about them. Basically, I was experiencing the emotions of various kids, and the surroundings were also different, like somewhere like it's slum. I was feeling sad for them.",26,3,3,HappyLand,LVLA,2,2
"It was thrilling and adventurous, felt very happy, like it was a new experience for me. Yes, I want to do it after watching, then I like, okay, fine, it's good. It was like, And I'm just running and we are going to jump off the cliff. I was only excited.",26,3,4,Speedflying,HVHA,5,1
"That was very pleasant and soothing. I was feeling very happy, and like I'm in a very peaceful place. I love beaches. Yeah, it changed basically, I started feeling that rush that I'm doing some adventurous thing while on the ship, and also at the end, oh, the sunset was very pretty, pretty, I really liked it.",26,3,5,InstantCaribbean,HVLA,5,1
"I was scared and terrified. Because I saw that it's in a jail scenario and they are handling a criminal, so that's why I was feeling scared and I was looking at that person as well, that what he is doing, what he's going to do next. There was certain ancipation. I was just, like, a third person who is watching everything, it's like I am some kind of a cameraman and I'm just recording everything, what's going on.",26,3,6,Jailbreak,LVHA,1,4
"It was a story of two kids, yeah, and I was feeling like why war happens and so the emotion was I'm sad, I was sad like and what you say I was feeling bad that we are creating these scenarios. Yeah, I understood the story that there was a war, meaning attacks in their village, and when they returned, everything was so different, and they were just trying to figure out their old lifestyles. Ans then their was boy who fled with her monther, and was thinking it would be better if he was eaten by a crocodile then being dead by the army fighters. I see that how he is moving in this swamp area. I cannot feel myself walking in the swamp area or something like that, but I was just watching it like a story and a movie.",26,3,7,TheDisplaced,LVLA,2,3
"oh god, was scared of by this height as well. yeah, I felt like but again I was sitting on a chair and that, but still I felt like oh god, what will happen. I am scared of height. I'm jumping off somewhere.",26,3,8,CanyonSwing,HVHA,5,4
"unrelatable, so i don't i could not feel anything particularly. it was more or less like it's happening, it's going on, it's going on. Neutral. I can’t relate to it so it was more or less like a movie i am watching and i am just watching it, It is nothing relevant to me. yeah the kidnapper did not look, you know, kidnappers. so even a point why did not feel relatable because it was not like you know, scary, not scary but frightening. it was not that way. ",27,4,1,Kidnapped,LVHA,3,1
"it was more calming and a good experience, i could completely relate to it because that's what we do. it was more of like holiday vacation kind of experience, chilling. yeah audio has a bit more impact, i will say because initially, i could not realize it is a sunrise video until after a while i saw the sun come but, before that the audio was making all the impact and i don't know if you know, but there's a small crab in the video, that yeah that is something catchy. eah it was good, it was- i felt like i was there, i could- there was a person sitting behind as well, there was some wind, and i could not feel the wind, like could not listen the wind, but i could listen the waves the sound of ocean and all.",27,4,2,MalaekahanaSunrise,HVLA,5,4
"same as first one, i could not relatable and not panicky, it should be a panic situation but i could not feel panic throughout. secondly the audio was not clear what they were talking, it was something random and someone saying something else, someone saying something to there was no coordination or nothing, trying to make a panic situation. initially it looked like there's a war kind of thing happening because they were suiting up and they were- someone was saying no, one guy in a black suit like a raw agent or some kind of agent is there, that made that thing but it was not like zombie, i could not relate to zombie thing until zombies came and zombies were even not as scary and active, they were very slow, no one was running behind anyone, no nothing.",27,4,3,ZombieApocalypse,LVHA,3,1
"it was fun, playful. I like puppies in real life. yeah that's why i could relate to all of these, and the people sitting in there like happy and chilling, and it was like how you feel. yeah the only thing that i could feel was at some time the video was imbalanced you know, half half, because puppies was jumping. that did not do anything, it was more like i could not feel he’s sitting on me, felt like it was on the camera and blocking the view, it was like that. it was not that he the puppy sitting on me or near me or it was not- i could not feel that. yeah and watching people playing with them and they are happy so it is also making me happy, they are also impacting me.",27,4,4,PuppiesHost,HVHA,5,4
"this was cool, scary because if you see- I thought of it as a paragliding experience, that i am- though it's a drone shot it was meant to be that only that you are sailing or some kind of thing, i could feel that. a bit scary, I knew it was not shot in that sense but if I would have experienced it  it was scary, nervous and good scary,  exciting. no the aeroplane, it was going right, so there was someone who was going out it made a bit impact just adding in more objects which is somewhat exciting.",27,4,5,GreatOceanRoad,HVLA,4,4
"yeah could feel it completely, like this this was more or less like a state where, a state you are in like lost- yeah helpless, it could make me feel helpless and, initially i was expecting something to happen but eventually i realized it's just the same thing, and the audio- audio was not clear i could not understand much of it, but the music initial music, that's the slow music that made the impact, and it basically it was a sad- completely a sad experience. i did not feel an urge to move out because it was like if i am there, i am there because of something, so like you know it's like i need to deal with this, then only i can move out. it was like that, this is happened so i am responsible for that so i need to fix it . ",27,4,6,AbandonedBuilding,LVLA,2,3
"it was more like i’d say sad, it was not guilty or anything because natural thing, but it was like sad, a lot, overall a very emotional thing.  i won't say relatable, i’d say relatable only because i have seen- i have read about these articles such articles or ive seen some videos before like this bad destruction can happen, that way it was somewhat relatable but overall the impact that it wanted to set, the environment, sad environment and any like remorse,  it was there. i could feel all those emotions.  it was more because of the environment or the like if i see down there is debris and I am- there is someone else also standing with me, so i could relate because he is there I am also there. So the environment or the other person made me feel that i was there.",27,4,7,NepalEarthquake,LVLA,1,4
this one did not make me feel anything much because- because i have already experience it. yeah that was way better so i could not feel anything much here.,27,4,8,MegaCoaster,HVHA,3,2
"Actually, In this one I was curious, about what's happening. In the end, It was funny. They were pointing the revolver at them. Last part was funny. He was like you got the person. I was intially calm. But then in last it was little funny only the last portion when they were talking.",28,4,1,Kidnapped,LVHA,3,2
"I was very calm. I was enjoying the whole sunrise. But there was one person sitting at my back, so I was just curious or is a bit nervous. You can say, I was thinking what is going to happen with him. But at last, I feel relaxed. That nothing is going to happen. I was enjoying this. I like sitting on the beach.",28,4,2,MalaekahanaSunrise,HVLA,4,1
"I was not feeling good. I mean, I was thinking it is somewhat a terrorist attack, so my normal reaction was like nervousness, a little afraid, like why are they shooting those people? Somewhere i felt like i’m in the scene and somewhere I felt like I was in Virtual reality towards the end of the video not intially.",28,4,3,ZombieApocalypse,LVHA,2,3
"In this, I was figuring out where I am standing and like who am I. Later, I realized that I am the mat over which they are feeding and all. That person was sitting, right? So, at that point of time, I felt irritated, but otherwise, I was enjoying the puppies. I like puppies in real life. But I seeing everything from the ground so it was a bit irritating in between. I like puppies but I have never been to a place with so many puppies and i have only seen it in movies.",28,4,4,PuppiesHost,HVHA,4,1
"this was so calming, and i was even excited. yes specially i was thinking like just like i am a bird and i can see the bird eye view of australia. It was a new perspective. I was engaged in the video.",28,4,5,GreatOceanRoad,HVLA,5,1
"I was thinking why is it abandoned and then those quotes i was thinking it is somewhat a terrorist area. I was a little afraid in the initial phase, then there was that voice, yeah, after that, it subsided. Among them, those particular written scriptures, like the text on the walls of abandoned... You know, completely abandoned houses, created that feeling of fear initially. But then I got distracted by the audio.",28,4,6,AbandonedBuilding,LVLA,3,2
"I was feeling sad for the people who lost their life and houses. I have experienced an earthquake two times, so it was like familiar. I have also heard a lot about the recent earthquake, 2002 or something like that.  I was feeling like I was actually seeing those. The black background was kind of a distraction, and it made me realize that I am currently in VR. Yeah, right. I also felt a bit of a feeling of mercy. I was feeling bad for them, having to stand in such a long queue. Compared to watching them in the news, I was feeling a little sad for them. And there was also one child, one child was crying in that.",28,4,7,NepalEarthquake,LVLA,2,2
"I was not feeling good. Yeah, I do like roller coasters, but it was getting quite weird because there was round and round and all that stuff. No, it's not like that, it's like I don't do, I don't get that, but then I pretty much got used to it. It was causing a slight discomfort.",28,4,8,MegaCoaster,HVHA,3,3
"I felt a bit sad because ukraine war is going on currently as well, so we know a bit about it but we have- I personally have never seen an account from the children's perspective like how was the families individually affected so it was a bit of an eye opening experience. actually I prefer not to watch these contents because i know i feel bad about it and right now i can't do anything about it, so I sometimes feel that maybe one if i am in a position to do something about it, i would do but I cannot.  I think it was pretty much the same emotion, but like whenever I saw the i think when I saw the faces of the children I felt a bit more sad, but while the narration was going on it was pretty much constant.  I was thinking what if similiar things happen to us.",29,1,1,TheDisplaced,LVLA,3,3
"this was even sadder than the previous one because you see such slum areas everyday in india only. and again same situation like, i can't do anything about it, so i prefer not to watch or interact with this sort of things. yeah plus there are more children as well so that also made it more sad. yeah i mean i think i was very interested in looking at children, how they were you know, trying to come into the video, some were trying to avoid. So i think that was fun but- i think the previous video we had this text as well, so i was able to get more clarity as to what they are trying to focus on, this was a very- slum tour felt very generalized, i could not find any particular agenda for this. yeah yeah i mean they just said she was a volunteer then she came, she was surprised to see, that is very generic so it- just this whole video felt very generalized. okay i think it was like a movie only to me. because like as part of community work i have actually interacted with this sort of population and that feeling is very different compared to this one. ",29,1,2,HappyLand,LVLA,3,2
"I was excited, It felt like a thrilling movie. like i enjoyed the angles where we were in the scene- because most of the angles here from the perspective of a camera, from a cctv camera. i felt that is fine but like this particular scene that we are seeing right now, like he was in the jail, we could see that how the other person distracted and he quickly unlocked his- so that i feel is very nice, you never get to see those sort of scenes. but additionally also i am a bit familiar with this topic, i sort of look at such videos on youtube so it was nice.  yeah it felt like this is not a realistic situation to me. But I enjoyed the content.",29,1,3,Jailbreak,LVHA,4,3
" this one was also like a movie only to me because the pearl harbor movie is very famous, almost everybody has watched it, so this felt like a short clip from that movie only. My response was excited again. yeah because like, on screen, we have all watched movies but from a VR perspective and you know seeing that tank shot was also nice. I enjoyed watching this.  yeah i mean i did not see it much from a history perspective, i saw it from a movie perspective only so i did not attach the history component to it.",29,1,4,Warknownonation,LVHA,4,3
"It was nice exciting. yeah i was thinking more i want to do such adventurous activity in real life also. but i went to dubai recently so i did roller coasters there, they were also pretty high some of the roller coasters, so i got the similar thrill i would say. that weightlessness. a bit like when he jumped for the first time and it showed going down i think my legs- i don't know if they reacted or not but i think they reacted a bit, but then of course i realized i am still on the ground.  yeah i mean the way the person was encouraging that you have to go, that is very real, that is how it happens i guess.",29,1,5,CanyonSwing,HVHA,5,4
" initially it was- like the first five 10 seconds it was nice tall trees but after that it was boring.  i think that experience is very different, actually walking through a park and you know- i think the sounds were nice here but in reality it feels more peaceful, you feel the air, you feel the difference while breathing, i think all that makes a very huge difference.",29,1,6,Redwoods,HVLA,4,1
"yeah, i think this was the most favorite. yeah, like it made me feel like i want to do this in real life now.  yeah yeah it was nice actually nice, i looked downwards towards the birds as well, so that i could feel that i was actually in the air not just looking at the person in front, and in between you know also started to tilt like this so that was also very nice. i think this was nice, i did not- like i think there is a subconscious realization that you in vitual reality but for me it did not happen, plus i have never done anything like this, i have not not even seen videos like this before so this was like the first thing first time i’m seeing anything like this so i forgot that this is not real. yeah the music is also energetic so that also made the heartbeat faster. ",29,1,7,Speedflying,HVHA,5,4
"It was okay I think. i mean i think, again it was a bit more about nature right, we saw beaches, we saw the sea, and then we saw the water slides. that experience, it just felt artificial i would say.  i think the shot is fine, i think they can't do a better job at this but the narration was i think for the narration part you know it was an advertisement, so i think this might be a personal thing but i not i do not like that advertisement voice, i don't like the advertisement, the way they speak, they trying to sell something all the time so i think that might have made a difference.",29,1,8,InstantCaribbean,HVLA,4,3
"I did not feel much. Since this is my first VR experience, I was more focused on seeing what is happening around me. The video quality was good, it felt like i was watching with those children.",31,1,1,TheDisplaced,LVLA,5,5
"I was correlating scenarios, like the slums we see in our country vs what was shown in the video. So i kept thinking that I have seen some similar parts here and there, so I was able to correlate. And i have been involved in doing social work as well, so it did not feel bad that I cannot help them. It did not leave that much impact because I have seen such situations around me in my life experiences. ",31,1,2,HappyLand,LVLA,5,4
"I was curious for this. It was like I was watching a movie and enjoying it. I was trying to see every bit that was being shown, and I was constantly wondering how is he opening the handcuffs and all. I was anticipating the next move. It was very exciting. when he started running then i was looking around if anyone is coming to catch him or not.",31,1,3,Jailbreak,LVHA,5,4
"This was very sad, because one of my friends is in the army so i felt like he is going on war. With VR i was trying to see things very closely as well. It felt like i was there watching it",31,1,4,Warknownonation,LVHA,5,4
"This was very exciting, i like doing such activities. I was not scared at all, so I enjoed it a lot. I was feeling like someone gave me this activity to do and I was doing it.The perspective was also nice.I want to do such things in the future",31,1,5,CanyonSwing,HVHA,5,4
"I was correlating with this because I have been to forests before. I felt calm, I felt peace from within. The bird chirping and natural sounds helped me achieve that. It felt like i was in a forest",31,1,6,Redwoods,HVLA,5,4
"I was very excited for this. It felt like  I am moving with the audio, it was exciting. It felt like I was watching others fly, like watching a video. It did not feel like i was flying myself, because one person was flying in front of  the camera so i was watching him fly.",31,1,7,Speedflying,HVHA,5,4
"This was calm, soothing. It felt nice watching the sunset and all. I did not pay much attention to the narration, because i was busy watching the video",31,1,8,InstantCaribbean,HVLA,5,4
"I already had an idea about this event, so emotionally I don't think I really had much of a response to it. I just liked knowing about it, that made me interested what was happening. Being there through the camera did not add much, I was just watching it and getting more information. The narration was also clear, but it felt like a documentary. It is like a close view of what is happening. ",32,2,1,NepalEarthquake,LVLA,3,1
"I was excited at first, but it was too chaotic and I could not really grasp what was happening. I lost interest due to that. I was still attentive because I was looking at what was happening, but by the end of it i lost interest. It was chaotic mostly becuase of the way it was shot, that one zombie was taking all my attention. It felt more like a game, without any natural emotional responses",32,2,2,ZombieApocalypse,LVHA,3,1
"I was really confused as to what they wanted to show. I could get that I was in an abondoned place, but ssince i was expecting that, it did not do much. In the middle i did listen to the announcement being made, and the music was relaxing so I thought why not lets just listen to the music. It was calming since i like abandoned areas. It was relaxing and calming. It was nice, I was completely still in one place and there was no one there, so it gave a feel that I was there",32,2,3,AbandonedBuilding,LVLA,4,1
"It felt like a movie, but i was excited for what was going to happen. I felt like something cool is happening. I was very interested in listening to them, and what was going on. I tried to become the person in the video from the camera perspective but i was not able to. Since this was a comedy, i was enjoying most of the parts.",32,2,4,Kidnapped,LVHA,4,1
"I personally was not into it in the beginning because I know what real rollercoasters feel like. I have extreme motion sickness, so I was wondering if this will affect me a lot or something. And then it was affecting me, I was really getting dizzy, not anxious but dizzy. I was getting a headache and strain, but i know it usually happens with rollercoasters. I liked the views. I was trying to look at the people behind me rather than looking in front, but that was mostly to explore the surroundings, and when it started i started looking in front. But it was not very close to the real experience, since I know i am sitting in this chair in the lab. I am familiar with VR ehadsests so I was aware that this is in VR.",32,2,5,MegaCoaster,HVHA,3,1
"First i was just  just seeing the sea, I did not pay attention to the sun, then i realised oh the sun is rising so i started looking at it. I looked around, someone was sitting as well. I realised nothing else is happening and the focus is sunrise so I came back to it. I was anticipating something will happen but nothing did. I was relaxed but also trying to look around and anticipate some interaction. The audio was realistic so it was nice. ",32,2,6,MalaekahanaSunrise,HVLA,3,1
"I loved this, I love puppies in real life so I enjoyed this video a lot. I felt the lower camera angle was much better because I could see the puppies up close and it was a new perspective. The audio matched my excitement. I could notice some lines in teh video due to the camera but it was okay",32,2,7,PuppiesHost,HVHA,5,1
"This was nice because I could see down as well, since all the videos till now did not have that perspective where I can look down too. It was calming and I liked the perspective. I was getting interested and I enjoyed it",32,2,8,GreatOceanRoad,HVLA,3,1
"I think it is a different experience when you hear about such things versus wwhen you see them. Some scenes really affected me, some made me angry some made me sad, i had mixed negative emotions. It was immersive, the story was clear as well. Camera angles were pretty nice, all the scenes were arranged nicely together. There were scenes wehre i felt fearful as well. The audio was one of the best out of all the videos. It felt like i was watching this as a third person, like an immersive museum, it felt like a camera in history.",33,3,1,Warknownonation,LVHA,4,5
"This felt a bit fake, especially the voices. It felt jittery, not a nice experience. The camera angles were fine, so I felt like I was there. But since I have had an accident in teh past, this madee me recall some of that and it made me uncomfortable.",33,3,2,Redwoods,HVLA,2,5
"I was very confused as to what is happening, because in some audios and scenes i was not able to relate. They started talking about topics like entrepreneurs and that did not connect well with what was going on. I have been to the slums before, so i think a lot of the scenarios, especially thee kids pointing to the camera, the seemed very real and I could feel those a lot. It created a very real experience, it made me connect more. Seeing this actually did not make me feel sad or empathetic because i have seen areas like these but the emotions amongst the children made me feel happy",33,3,3,HappyLand,LVLA,3,2
"The camera cut in the middle was very disturbing and distracting. The only point of the video was to show the front and the stitch was right there. It was always visible, and it became very unreal because of that. I could not feel much because of it. The whole experience was still good, but it felt fake and it could have had a greater impact. ",33,3,4,Speedflying,HVHA,4,3
"A lot of areas here were very calming but with very sharp cuts in the middle. If the video was a single experience and did not have any cuts in between it would have felt so much better. It did not feel that immersive, it felt like a  lot of videos were just put together. The narration made it feel like an advertisement rather than an experience. ",33,3,5,InstantCaribbean,HVLA,4,3
"Even this had a lot of cuts, but it felt immersive despite them. I felt like the audio added a lot to this, i felt connected to the prisoner itself, it brought a feeling that does not happen with normal videos. I really hope that the prisoner could be free. I related to the prisoner more  becuase of movies and shows, becuase of that i could feel the captivity that he would have felt. I felt like i was in his place. I also felt anxious at points, wanting to get free in the video. The way the video was shot it made me look at it from a first person's POV. ",33,3,6,Jailbreak,LVHA,3,4
"This video felt a bit rushed. Before I could attach myself to a video it very quickly changed the subject. Some parts of it really affected me though. It felt like someone actually destroyed my home. I could see them fighting to get their home back, so that felt very good. I liked the narration in the ukraine one better, so i could relate to it more than Sudan. ",33,3,7,TheDisplaced,LVLA,2,5
"This felt very real. one feeling i had while watching this video was that this is something i have to live and work for. so i feel that way it really did make me happy and excited, and gave me very positive inspiration.",33,3,8,CanyonSwing,HVHA,5,5
"I was able to understand the context. This felt a bit funny because they did not feel professional at all. They were talking too much and they kidnapped the wrong person as well, so it felt funny. I felt like I was the one being kidnapped. I felt a sense of amusement as well. Later in one scene the setting was a bit too dark so I could not see the man coming and all, but it was okay. ",34,4,1,Kidnapped,LVHA,5,3
"I felt calm, pleasant and beautiful. It was a beautiful scenery, but it felt more like a sunset than a sunrise. it was blissful. I could see the wind blow and the sky was blue. I was expecting it to be amusing and give me some excitement, or something would  be going on, because of the previous video that i watched. Once i realised tha tmnothing else will happen, i started enjoying it. It felt more artificial than a real beach though, since real breaches usually have people, some garbage as well, and i could see the wind but not feel it. that made me realise i am in VR. ",34,4,2,MalaekahanaSunrise,HVLA,5,1
"I have seen a few zombie movies, so this video was similar to those. I also started realising the order of videos that were presented to me, one exciting then  calm then  exciting again. some parts were a bit too low lit so I could  not see much, but that did not incite panic or uneasiness in me. I was not able to relate to the situation much so i was just enjoying the content. Usually such situations are very blood filled and have a lot of violence and panic. This did not match that standard so it felt less dramatised. ",34,4,3,ZombieApocalypse,LVHA,4,2
"Puppies are cute, but there wasn't much emotion in this one. I was entertained. I like dogs as long as they do not bite. I have a lot of dogs in my locality that keep barking on people, and when i was a child the dogs used to run after me when i went cycling. They once bit the tires of my bike so I am somewhat neutral towards dogs. But if there is a cute puppy coming towards me and it licks me I'll be fine, I'll pet it and maybe feed it as well. The camera angle made it more fun due to the new perspective it brought. But the audio was bad since the song was distracting and loud, i could not hear the natural sounds of that environment. ",34,4,4,PuppiesHost,HVHA,5,1
"This felt like an advertisement for a show. I haven't been to a beach but i have seen a lot of videos. The video was shot while parasailing and I have done that, so it felt real. it felt more real than the beach that was showed. The sailing angle added to the experience. It made me excited to see parasailing, but just for a few seconds. The animated transition was a bit abrupt.",34,4,5,GreatOceanRoad,HVLA,5,1
"I felt confused and a fit uneasy since there was nobody, the sky was grey, the buildings surrounded me and it felt unnatural and unsafe. The environment felt like a dystopian world where people have been enslaved and the speaker was the speach which was being delivered by the government. It was not a pleasant experience. Given the pattern that I had in my mind about the order of the videos, this video should have been an exciting one but it broke the pattern which left me confused a bit. The speech made me more uncomfortable.",34,4,6,AbandonedBuilding,LVLA,3,1
"This was uneasy and unpleasant. I felt empathy towards the people, it felt back because nothing good happened in that situation and a lot of things were destroyed, a lot of people would have died, and the impact was more since it is a neighbouring country of ours. I haven't experienced natural disasters in my life, but seeing it as a third person i was familiar with the emotions. My sister used to live in an area which used to get flooded and she sent actual videos of the disaster, so i could relate a bit. When there were people around me, i felt like i was one of them.The narration was subtle and gave me time to think about the video. ",34,4,7,NepalEarthquake,LVLA,2,1
"I have never been on one, I am scared of roller coasters, so I enjoyed this video, and midway I felt a little uneasy, in a pleasant way because of the motion, the velocity, and I enjoyed the experience, it was fun, it was fun and excited.",34,4,8,MegaCoaster,HVHA,5,2
"I saw three children were displaced and they were actually having a hard life so i just thought actually the they are living this life due to us. For example, if we wanted to we could stop the Russia-Ukraine war, we could have done something from our side but we did not do anything. Even if we did anything, it was euqal to nothing, so somewhere we are also responsible for such dire situations of these children. I feel that we should help them, take them out of this situation, give them a proper education and health care etc. The text was readable in the video. There was a Sudan section as well, but the Russia-Ukraine section felt more relatable due to the recent events. I was wondering how did this child land in such a destructive situation. It felt like a documentary, I did not feel like i was actually there. ",35,1,1,TheDisplaced,LVLA,3,3
"The narrator was trying to show how the slums were exploited and don't get enough resources, and how there is a hotel just 5 kms from here. There is a huge difference in the standard of living. It made me want to help them, i felt sorry for them and empathetic. I did not think much before watching, but felt these emotions while watching the video. The narration helped me quite a bit. I felt like I was standing there, because a kid was staring at the camera and it felt like  he's looking at me. The video could have been better quality. ",35,1,2,HappyLand,LVLA,3,3
"This video felt good if i was the prisoner, but bad if i was the policeman. I saw it from the prisoner's perspective, so i felt like finally i'm free. The camera was also from his perspective. I felt like I would feel what the prisoner is feeling. I have seem a lot of such movies as well, so it felt relatable. ",35,1,3,Jailbreak,LVHA,4,4
"War is not a good place to be in, and the soldiers were being seperated from their families, that did not feel nice. The family knew that their family member was going in a hell like situation. He could be shot, he might not come back. I saw a movie recently so it felt more impactful to watch this video. The tank scene felt quite real. the transition was also very good. The audio and quality could have been better, but it did not hinder my experience. ",35,1,4,Warknownonation,LVHA,2,4
"This was quite exciting. I would have felt scared and nervous as well if i was in his stead. When the person jumped it felt relieving, i felt the fullness of life, if i was there it would have been the best moment of my life. It was exciting but i did not feel like i was the one doing it. I was just enjoying it as a third person. I have a fear of heights, and this video did not seem like it was happening to me becuase if I was there, I would have been very low and bent down to ensure I am not standing stright up. I was trying to somehow make the video do that which was not possible, and hence it did not feel real. I intentionally avoided looking when he jumped becuase I was scared. When his friends mentioned that it was a 200 ft tall rope, I kept imagining how deep that fall could be",35,1,5,CanyonSwing,HVHA,5,5
"At my native place we have a garden and woods, so i keep roaming in such scenes. It felt familiar because of that. I like exploring such places, but i would also be scared of appearances of wild animals. I was slightly alert because of that. I felt like i was watching a movie becuase the camera was static. I wanted to get up and move around. The transitions were very slow as well.  ",35,1,6,Redwoods,HVLA,5,3
"This is one of my life dreams. The parachute gives a sense of safety but when the forests came i got a bit scared. I was thinking what if the parachute gets stuck in that tree and I crash. I got a bit scared and nervous when the trees came. I was very excited otherwise. The uplifitng music made me feel more excited, but i felt like a third person. ",35,1,7,Speedflying,HVHA,5,5
"I have never been on a beach so this is also a dream of mine. After seeing this, the rides, ships and all, the sunset was actually very nice. I did feel that I am in a VR setting and this is not really me. This was mostly due to the narration and the camera angles. The movements felt fake.",35,1,8,InstantCaribbean,HVLA,4,3
"I was very nervous for this, I felt very sad for all the houses that were destroyed and all the lives that were lost. I was able to comprehend what is happening at what moment. It took some time for me to see what is happening and for the sadness to set in. The VR immersion also added to the impact. I felt like i was there, witnessing all this, about 80% of the time. This was mostly because of the camera angle. The narration was also clear",36,2,1,NepalEarthquake,LVLA,1,1
"This made me feel a bit sad. I could not understand the concept of zombies, it feflt more like a war. I am usually affected by such events, hence I felt sad, because it felt like they are killing others in war. Later I started having a bit of fun, it felt like I am walking with them. The enarration was not very clear, but the audio added effect. ",36,2,2,ZombieApocalypse,LVHA,1,2
"I felt at peace, very pleasant and peaceful experience. I usually like being by myself, so I felt good here. The audio was not great, but it felt like I am sitting there. I liked the quality of the video and enjoyed it throughout. I did not feel any other mix of emotions",36,2,3,AbandonedBuilding,LVLA,4,4
"I feel afraid here, because I realised that there are kidnappings done by other people. I felt like the person in teh video just got kidnapped, but not so much that I got kidnapped. It also lead to nervousness, as I usually do not consume such content, I do not like thriller movies. ",36,2,4,Kidnapped,LVHA,1,2
"I felt happy and calm in this, with some moments of fear. I haven't been on rollercoasters before, but here at some instances i felt like i was actually in the rollercoaster. ",36,2,5,MegaCoaster,HVHA,3,3
"I felt very calm and happy in this. I haven't been on any beach in real life but in this video I roamed around everywhere, and since there was nobody else it felt nice. I saw the sunrise, and I like such scenes. I felt very present, and the video quality was good as well.",36,2,6,MalaekahanaSunrise,HVLA,5,3
"I like puppies in real life so this made me very happy as well. The camera angle was a bit up-down, so it felt a bit weird, but it did not hinder in my emotional experience. I did not like the music in this though. I did not feel present there, but I felt like an observer, a third person.",36,2,7,PuppiesHost,HVHA,5,3
"This was a good video, the drone perspective did not hinder anything much. The audio was good, and the transitions as well. I felt calm, and a bit of excitement.",36,2,8,GreatOceanRoad,HVLA,5,3
"I was wondering why it happened. I wanted to set the context, why did it happen, what happened, etc. Initially i was uncomforatble with teh VR as well, but it worked out eventually. The video showed both the active lives of soldiers and the emotions they go through. It made me feel multiple emotions. The audio caused some strain, since it tried to make me attentive and focus. I did not feel like i was there as a person, It felt like they were showing it to me through a screen and I was just watching. I felt 70% immersed, while for movies it is around 30-40%, so it was more immersive for sure. I also got excited since I was put in a tank and I have never seen one from the inside.",37,3,1,Warknownonation,LVHA,3,3
"it gave me a sense of peace, but since the last video was about war i felt that in this as well there will be some attack from somewhere, so I was initially on alert. I was impacted by the last video and expected something similar throughout the first half of this video as well, but after that i felt sleepy. I was at peace with the natural sounds, bird chirps, and waterfalls. I was sleepy because  of all that and I was relaxed. I felt like I was on the bridge",37,3,2,Redwoods,HVLA,4,4
"I had a very questioning mindset, regarding the hows, whys and whats of the video. I wwas ashamed in a sense, because I felt that somewhere we all are responsible for this happening in our world. I felt sad upset and emotional. I wanted to help them, since I have been to slums in real life and I interact with children there a lot. This is why i felt so emotional, and that sense was strong. The transitions were not very nice, then i was not able to realte because i had to search so much whenever the scene changed. The narration was responsible for a lot of engagement. I sometimes had to read the captions to understand as well. When people were looking at the camera, I felt like they were looking at me.",37,3,3,HappyLand,LVLA,2,3
"I was excited for this, the audio added a lot to that emotion as well. The camera was at tehe wrong angle though, because it felt like i was on the person's head rather than at their eye level. I am also afraid of heights, but the camera was not clear to show the actual depth of that height so i did not feel scared. ",37,3,4,Speedflying,HVHA,4,4
"I am not very used to islands and I do not want to be, but it felt good when they were jsut flying in the sky watching the sea, but this was only in the initial stages of the video. I liked the drone angle and I felt happy when the sunset was happening, it made me feel caalm and composed. I did noto notice the narration that much so it was not very helpful, i just focused on watching the video",37,3,5,InstantCaribbean,HVLA,5,4
"I felt alert and attentive, since there was such an active criminal in the video. I was having sympathy for the criminal in the beginning, since I was relating to it as i had watched a web series 2 days ago called Money Heist. In that series the father of the criminal was killed by the policeman so these scenes were relatable in that sense. I felt sad because i had thatt association with the web series, but later i realised these are 2 different scenarios. Then when the criminal started doing more activities like opening his handcuffs, I became attentive. It felt like a movie in some sense, but mostly because I have seen similar things before",37,3,6,Jailbreak,LVHA,3,3
"I was sad and upset, again questioning the hows and the whys. I was able to see more impact with the audio, and the text was also legible. I was able to relate to the swamps in the video more since it mentioned there were crocodiles and all. The narration left a huge imapact since it was highlighting the challenges faced. ",37,3,7,TheDisplaced,LVLA,2,4
"I was a bit troubled by the 2 different camera angles. It was not consistent and i could not feel the depth. I was excited, and little bit scared. The audio was better since there was no music and i could hear all the things that were happening in the video rather than listening to music, it felt more realistic that way",37,3,8,CanyonSwing,HVHA,4,4
"I was curious. I wanted to know what is happening around me as I was uncertain about it. I did not have any problems navigating around, and I understood that I am within a VR setting. Initially I could not tell that they are talking to me but then soon i realised that i was being kidnapped, but i did not feel like that, because objectively I knew i am in VR, but it was very close to reality. I felt a little anxious, but only to know what exactly was happening. The conversations were not very clear either, so I could not understand them.",38,4,1,Kidnapped,LVHA,3,2
"Initially, I was expecting that there would be some movement or some activity like the previous one. But then I understood that this is a beach view, and then I went into enjoying and experiencing the video. It was a bit similar to real life beach experiences, but not completely. The camera quality was sufficiently good, but if it was better it could have been nicer. Since there was no wind as well, I could tell that this is not real life, but the video was very good. it created a sense of calm and wonder within me, which usually happens in real life as well. I felt that I wanteed to walk around and go to the person sitting behind me, I was expecting some activity to happen, but eventually I understood that this is just a person, and I'm also expected to enjoy with him.",38,4,2,MalaekahanaSunrise,HVLA,4,1
"I was majorly irritated. I thought that this was a video where there is a soldier camp or something, and somebody has come inside it and some war is being announced and they have to go. And then when I saw the zombies and all, and then it felt unnatural. I am noto familiar with these types of content, I do not watch such movies a lot. The zombies felt like humans only, it felt like a movie, like i am watching from a third-person's perspective.",38,4,3,ZombieApocalypse,LVHA,2,4
"I felt very warm and nice watching these videos. Warm and nice people, people being happy around. I like puppies in real life.  I tuned myself that this might be a camera that might be kept there, and then the puppy is coming very close to me, that created a sense of excitement also, cheerfulness kind of emotion. Since the camera was so low in height  initially, I felt that I might be the puppy itself, a very small creature. But then I eventually realized that the camera where it is being kept.",38,4,4,PuppiesHost,HVHA,4,2
"I felt warm and happy watching this. I could realise that this was captured using a drone, and I am able to feel the way it ususally is in blogs and videos. Initially I thought i was being taken up and above, but then i realised it was a drone. there were slight changes of view, that made me realise that this s a video which i am watching and is not an experience, it impacted my immersion and i got conscious of the fact that I am in VR. ",38,4,5,GreatOceanRoad,HVLA,4,2
"After a certain point of time, it felt very lonely and uncomfortable. Not very lonely, but it started feeling a little uncomfortable. it made me think in a philosophical way, like nobody being around and maybe this place is being abandoned or I am being left alone. It generated a negative emotion within me. I was expecting some activity to happen around, but there wasn't.",38,4,6,AbandonedBuilding,LVLA,2,3
"I became sad to know about this situation, and I felt sorry for it. I felt a little helpless, like what to do about it. I've heard it in the news, and I connected that there was an earthquake a few years back. I felt very sad and thought about the general temporary nature of life. The black circle below me hindered my experience a lot, but in some time i got used to it. the narration helped me a lot. there were certain parts to the video where I felt like I am one of them, standing in the queue to get food. The perspective felt very natural with the other people around me at the right height. ",38,4,7,NepalEarthquake,LVLA,2,3
"This was exciting and enjoyable. Initially I felt it very much, like we feel on slides. In some partes there were instances where the movement felt unreal becuase it is not that scary as it is in a real rollercoaster which I have experienced a lot. But still, there were clear moments of a real feeling within the video. Once i start enjoying the cideos I start feeling the way they are supposed to feel in real life. ",38,4,8,MegaCoaster,HVHA,4,4
"I could feel the sense of seperation. The part where the family members of the soldiers were crying or saying goodbye or something, I think that was the main part for me where i focused. I could feel a bit sad, but not too much into the feeling. I could feel more for the family bonding, but not that sad, like I won't cry after watching this. Due to unfamiliarity with VR, normally when you are watching a video on television screen or something, or in real life, you are more attentive as like all of a sudden something happens you will be reacting quickly, but here it was a bit different for me. I was trying to be more attentive, but I couldn't. The audio made me feel more present. I haven't been in a war situation, but I could relate to it based on the movies I've watched, some of them were on world war 2 and all.",39,3,1,Warknownonation,LVHA,4,4
"I felt like I wanted to meditate. I would love to be there, it was very calming. i was like focusing on the different sounds that were there of birds and bird chips. Initially there was a photographer but we couldnt see him later, really so nobody else was there, so i was trying to find if there are like birds or other human beings in the video, but there were none. I felt like was actually there. I was trying to feel what I would feel if i was really there, obviously I knew this was not real but the entire focus was to feel and try to be there in that moment. I was voluntarily trying myself. I thought maybe just for for a few seconds or for that minute I could meditate. The slow transitions helped a bit, but i think there were different frames and they werent smooth transitions, there was some frame and then there was something else. If it was a continuous video I would have maybe felt better.",39,3,2,Redwoods,HVLA,5,5
"This scenario we keep seeing it around us also, so this was something we are very familiar of, we are used to. So here the only thing that came to my mind was that i also want to do something like this to help or something.I was mostly thinking about these things and i was listening to what that lady was saying about helping the children and that one girl. I was feeling a little sad about the situation where they have to just live in the slum and they dont have basic facilities, i was also observing like some of the girls have good clothes, they were wearing pretty clothes and some of them had nothing. It ffelt like a third person perspective, like somebody who is standing there watching everything happen. i actually felt like connected, because the most of the children they were looking into the camera so it felt like they are looking at me and we are having a direct eye contact so yeah it felt real that way, but i saw a circle whenever i looked down.",39,3,3,HappyLand,LVLA,4,1
"i actually felt as if it is me, i wanted to feel it because i havent done it in real as of yet, and maybe i'll do it in the future. i couldnt do it so i felt why not experience it now? While I can experience this, I also felt that it would have been better if we had like an Air Conditioner that could make it feel more realistic, if there was some wind near me, but otherwise it felt very real. I was excited, a bit motion sick but that was because of the mountains. I did not feel fear, and the music helped in this case, and I felt like i am actually doing it as that person",39,3,4,Speedflying,HVHA,5,4
"It did not feel that real, because we get to see this kind of a video on our televisions ro like mobiles. It felt like a 2d video to me, I couldn't relate to it. The sunset was pleasant to the eyes, but for other parts i think it felt okayish. The slide part, I could not feel that I was that person because in the first slide the camera was outside the slide, but changed in the second one, so did not feel real to me.The audio helped in understanding the scene, but only the sunset sscene was calming.",39,3,5,InstantCaribbean,HVLA,4,2
"I found this interesting, I did not feel like I am that person but still the camera was set up like I am supposed to be that person. In some places it was like that, and in other places it was as if i am a third person, but this video was nice. it felt thrilling and exciting, I was thinking what is going to happen next, and anticipating. I do not usually like such content but this was a short clip and it was good and engaging, but i wanted to see more at the end. it was dissapointing that it ended early, since i wanted to know if he escaped or not. It gave me a sense of excitement and by the end iwas dissapointed becuase I could not see the end. It would have been fine without narration as well.",39,3,6,Jailbreak,LVHA,4,5
"In this video I wanted to feel if I was tehre in the same situation, either noramlly or even in a war situation. I wanted to know how does it feel to leave your home. I felt sad, I was also curious to see how he survives. The subtitles were also pressent. I found the story interesting which made me engage with it more",39,3,7,TheDisplaced,LVLA,3,1
"I was thinking why do people do this, what is the need for all this. I did not want to do it. I knew I won't be shown blood and all but I was questioning again and again what if he falls and hits something, I was not interested in watching. I was trying to feel what would I feel in that situation if i was there, because I am not going to do it anyway. I tried to feel from his perspective, I could also feel some nausea and motion sickness, but I could not relate to this video.",39,3,8,CanyonSwing,HVHA,3,1
"I was into seeing around and where I am, tt was good. I did not feel much emotion because it felt like in a movie, and I felt like when I look down, there was a shirt and the neck. It was meant to be a little funny, I guess. I was not very scared. It was like a theatre experience, but I felt like I was that person, present in the car and all. But it was not very funny, more neutral",40,4,1,Kidnapped,LVHA,4,1
"It was pretty and nice. I felt happy, calm. I could not feel like I was sitting on the beach, it was more third person perspective in this one. It was not like I am sitting on the beach or something, but it was better than watching a movie. I felt like I could see around and all, that was nice. The audio added a lot of impact. It was looking like I’m viewing from above, the camera perspective was not like I was the person, because I could not see my body. It was not very realistic when compared to an actual beach experience.",40,4,2,MalaekahanaSunrise,HVLA,3,1
"I felt very bad, it was very loud and a lot of guns were present, and it did not feel good. It was like I could not figure out what's happening, I could not tell it was a zombie apocalypse. Now I know because you told me. It was scary and a bit irritating, due to the loud noises and guns and everything. I felt like i was there, but the audio gave a negative impact.",40,4,3,ZombieApocalypse,LVHA,5,4
"This was a happy video, I felt very happy. I like puppies in real life. The camera was kept low, which sometimes led me to not be able to figure out where the puppies are and all. The audio helped, it was very cheerful. I felt like I was there in the puppy cafe, like when dogs came towards my side, so I was able to figure out that. I could also see people holding the puppies and all, that was a good addition",40,4,4,PuppiesHost,HVHA,5,2
"I felt motion sickness in this one. I was feeling like I am above all this. Like, in a helicopter, watching all this, there was a lot of motion. But it was pretty, I liked it, the video was nice but just a bit motion sick.",40,4,5,GreatOceanRoad,HVLA,3,2
"After a minute or two I wanted to get out of there, I wanted the video to end. Because it was abandoned, there was no one, and I could not even move. If I could move, then I could have gone into the building and see what is going on there. But I could not move. There was just one place, which was irritating. I guess the whole concept is a very sad kind of a situation. ",40,4,6,AbandonedBuilding,LVLA,3,2
"This made me feel very bad. I did not feel like i was there, it was more of a third person perspective, and there were places where the people were bigger than the buildings due to the camera. That made me feel like i was not there. But yeah, the video in itself was very sad. One more factor was the language",40,4,7,NepalEarthquake,LVLA,2,4
"I felt pukish here. I knew that I am not in the roller coaster, because usually I feel very scared when I’m there. So, I knew that feeling was not there. I think this video is not good. I have been to rollercoasters when I was a kid.",40,4,8,MegaCoaster,HVHA,3,3
