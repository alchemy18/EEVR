The Arousal Valence Mapping on the labels of the Nurse dataset:

a) Arousal of the emotion: '1' is for high arousal and '0' is for low arousal. 
    nurse['label'] == 0: 0 (No Stress) 
    nurse['label'] == 1: 0 (Medium Stress) 
    nurse['label'] == 2: 1 (High Stress) 

b) valence of the emotion: '1' is for positive emotion (high valence) and '0' is for negative|neutral emotion (low valence)
    nurse['label'] == 0: 1 (No Stress) 
    nurse['label'] == 1: 0 (Medium Stress) 
    nurse['label'] == 2: 0 (High Stress)
